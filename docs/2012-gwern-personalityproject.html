<p align="left">What follows are the results based on your survey responses.  The results are grouped here into five categories: extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness.  These categories represent the way that
most people talk about personality and may therefore reflect cultural or social biases.</p>
<p align="left">While many or all of these categories may look like words you typically use (even ones that often are accompanied with
a value judgment) it is important to understand that these five factors are really labels used by psychologists
to describe differences between people.</p>

<p align="left">This is not psycho-analysis; the results presented here
were created directly from your responses to the items.  For that
reason, it is unlikely that there should be a mis-match between our
descriptions and how you or others view themselves.  However,
there is always room for error, and we would appreciate your feedback on
 our inventory and descriptions.  <a href="http://test.personality-project.org/survey/feedback.php?G=1&amp;Y=24&amp;A=2.7&amp;O=5.4&amp;C=4.2&amp;E=2.1&amp;S=4.8&amp;I=507237279&amp;M=0" target="_blank">Feedback can be left here.</a></p>

    </tbody></table><br><hr><h3 align="center">Extraversion Report</h3><p text-align:="" left=""></p><p>Extraversion
 is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts
enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience
positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented,
individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to opportunities
 for excitement. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and
draw attention to themselves.</p>

<p>Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of
extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and disengaged
from the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be
interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs less
stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone. The independence
and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or
arrogance. In reality, an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness
 dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when
approached.</p><p></p><p text-align:="" left=""></p><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

 score on Extraversion is low, indicating you are introverted, reserved,
 and quiet. You enjoy solitude and solitary activities. Your socializing
 tends to be restricted to a few close friends.</p><hr><h3 align="center">Agreeableness Report</h3><p text-align:="" left=""></p><p>Agreeableness
 reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social
harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are
 therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to
compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an
optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically
honest, decent, and trustworthy.</p>


<p>Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with
 others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and
therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes
their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious,
unfriendly, and uncooperative.</p>


<p>Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining
 popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people.
 On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that
require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can
make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.</p><p></p><p text-align:="" left=""></p><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

 concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our
impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad; occasionally time constraints
 require a snap decision, and acting on our first impulse can be an
effective response. Also, in times of play rather than work, acting
spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals can be
seen by others as colorful, fun-to-be-with, and zany.</p>


<p>Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of
ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not
only harm other members of society, but also can result in retribution
toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with
impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but
undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include excessive
socializing that leads to being fired from one's job, hurling an insult
that causes the breakup of an important relationship, or using
pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy one's health.</p>


<p>Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes a
 person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively
disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which
would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also
sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of
steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore
small, scattered, and inconsistent.</p>


<p>A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings
from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future
consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity involves
contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to
these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of
short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence
involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an
alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means both
wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the Conscientiousness scale
 are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.</p>


<p>The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious
individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through
purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded
by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be
 compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. Furthermore, extremely
conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring.
Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability, lack
of ambition, and failure to stay within the lines, but they will
experience many short-lived pleasures and they will never be called
stuffy.</p><p></p><p text-align:="" left=""></p><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

 stability is the opposite of emotional reactivity, which is the
tendency for oneâ&#8364;&#8482;s emotional state to be highly responsive to both
negative and positive situational cues. People low in emotional
stability are emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events
that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more
intense and consuming than normal. Low scorers are generally more
sensitive, emotional and prone to feelings that are upsetting, such as
anxiety or guilt.  Their pattern of experience can be described as an
â&#8364;&#339;emotional rollercoasterâ&#8364;&#157;.  They often experience swiftly
fluctuating emotions and are easily perturbed from a neutral state
toward emotional extremes, such as elation and excitement or anger and
agitation.  These problems in emotional regulation can diminish oneâ&#8364;&#8482;s
ability to think clearly, make rational decisions, and cope effectively
with stress.</p>


<p>At the other end of the scale, individuals who score high in
emotional stability are less easily upset and are less emotionally
reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from
persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not
mean that high scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; frequency
of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.</p><p></p><p text-align:="" left=""></p><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

 to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that
distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth,
conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious,
appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared
to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and
act in individualistic and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically
score high on Openness to Experience; consequently, this factor has also
 been called Culture or Intellect. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably
best regarded as one aspect of openness to experience. Scores on
Openness to Experience are only modestly related to years of education
and scores on standard intelligent tests.</p>


<p>Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for
thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete
experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual
abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical,
logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of
language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or
 performing arts. People with low scores on openness to experience tend
to have narrow, common interests. They prefer the plain,
straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle.
They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these
endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer
familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.</p>


<p>Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by
psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However,
open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments.
 The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well,
but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job
performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.</p><p></p><p text-align:="" left=""></p><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>
