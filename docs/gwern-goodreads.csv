15783514,"The Ocean at the End of the Lane","Neil Gaiman","Gaiman, Neil","",="0062255657",="9780062255655",4,"4.00","William Morrow Books","Hardcover","181",2013,2013,2014/06/28,2014/06/28,"","","read","A Gaiman novella of ~54236 words. It uses the device of a frame story around a flashback which is the meat of the novella. The frame story is a sad divorced English artist returning to where he grew up for a funeral, and recollecting the circumstances. This aspect is dry, mannered, and reminscent of Mitchell's <i>Black Swan Green</i> or Kazuo Ishiguro. The flashback is vintage Gaiman, with a plot predictable by anyone's who's read his young adult works (particularly <i>Coraline</i>): an ordinary person meets uncanny folk, gets inadvertently involved in deep matters, goes through hell, defeats the enemy, and survives more mature for it. The narrator is wry, with many acute observations (indeed, why <i>do</i> so many people destroy pea by overcooking them when they're tasty on their own?), and the antagonist is exceedingly cruel & clever in seducing & turning the protagonist's family against him. It's a quick read of perhaps 2 hours, and is not especially complex: the work is almost entirely set at the protagonist's home or the Hempstock farm, and shows its origins as a short story.<br/><br/>What makes this more than Gaiman going back to the well of mythos he has drawn from so many times before (oh look, <i>another</i> triune of mysterious powerful women! oh look, the fairy tale motif of the one forbidden action & of course the character does it) is the frame story's tone of sadness and loss and wasted opportunity which otherwise shows up rarely in Gaiman's fiction - it's comparable to the death of the Sandman. By the end, the protagonist is pitiable: it was his fault, time and again, and ultimately the sacrifice was for him, and what has he done with his life? Little enough. As the shadows warn him, ""There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing after something you cannot have, something you cannot even properly imagine, the lack of which will spoil your sleep and your day and your life, until you close your eyes for the final time, until your loved ones give you poison and sell you to anatomy, and even then you will die with a hole inside you, and you will wail and curse at a life ill-lived."" At the end, the best the trinity can say for him is that he's growing a new heart. Not that he'll remember even that faint progress report.<br/><br/>It's an interesting combo, and helps excuse some of the lamer bits. (Talk of electrons is jarringly out of place in a Gaiman work, and some aspects are too explicit about fantasy elements better left for the reader to wonder about.)","","","","","",0,,,,,

H. Lawrence, to determine where the lines should end""); <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Celan"">Paul Celan</a> is no exception in that most of his poems leave me simply baffled. Part of the problem is the shadow of the Holocaust lingering over many of the poems: an event too awesome and sublime to reduce to words, seemingly reducing Celan to slapping down words and fractured lines in frustration and despair, and not a little guilt, circling around the themes again and again (reminding me of Wittgenstein's famous introduction to <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>).<br/><br/>That said, a few of the poems or parts of the poems worked for me - not just the famous <a href=""http://mason.gmu.edu/~lsmithg/deathfugue.html"">""Fugue of Death""</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Fugue"">WP</a>) but several of the others. In poetry, a few gems is enough, because they stay with one in a way that prose rarely does, and so I forgive Celan for the poems I did not like and myself for the poems I did not get. Some excerpts:<br/><br/>""Aspen Tree..."", pg24:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Aspen tree, your leaves glance white into the dark. / My mother's hair was never white. / Dandelion, so green is the Ukraine. / My yellow-haired mother did not come home. / Rain cloud, above the well do you hover? / My quiet mother weeps for everyone. / Round star, you wind the golden loop. / My mother's heart was ripped by lead. / Oaken door, who lifted you off your hinges? / My gentle mother cannot return.""</blockquote><br/><br/>""Corona"", p32:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Autumn eats its leaf out of my hand: we are friends. / From the nuts we shell time and we teach it to walk: / then time returns to the shell.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""...We stand by the window embracing, and people look / up from the street: / it is time they knew! / It is time the stone made an effort to flower, / time unrest had a beating heart. / It is time it were time. / It is time.""</blockquote><br/><br/>""Fugue of Death"", pg33:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Black milk of daybreak we drink it at nightfall / we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night / drink it and drink it / we are digging a grave in the sky it is ample to lie there / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / he writes it and walks from the house the stars glitter / he whistles his dogs up / he whistles his Jews out and orders a grave to be dug in / the earth / he commands us strike up for the dance / Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night / we drink in the mornings at noon we drink you at / nightfall / drink you and drink you / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / Your ashen hair Shulamith we are digging a grave in the / sky it is ample to lie there...""</blockquote><br/><br/>""Thread Suns"", pg83:<br/><br/><blockquote>""...there are / still songs to be sung on the other side / of mankind.""</blockquote><br/><br/>""I Hear that the Axe has Flowered"", pg106:<br/><br/><blockquote>""I hear that the axe has flowered, / I hear that the place can't be named, / I hear that the bread which looks at him / heals the hanged man, / the bread baked for him by his wife, / I hear that they call life / our only refuge.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Ironically, the reason I looked up Celan in the first place was a Japanese novella (a doujin for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project"">Touhou</a>), <a href=""http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Iyokan"">Iyokan</a> & Surrounded By Enemies's <a href=""http://gallery.gensokyo.org/archive/Iyokan_and_Surrounded_by_Enemies_-_Dream_and_Reality.zip""><i>Dream and Reality</i></a>, included as a running theme quotes from Celan's <i>From Threshold to Threshold</i> (perhaps because <a href=""http://www.thewhitereview.org/features/celan-reads-japanese/"" title=""'Celan Reads Japanese', Susan Bernofsky (tr.), Yoko Tawada (2013)"">Celan's poems in Japanese bring out the repeated themes</a> of gates/thresholds/transitions, which complements the plot of the novella & a <a href=""http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yukari_Yakumo"">key character</a>). I had been particularly struck by the poem ""The Guest"" from <i>Threshold</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Long before nightfall / someone who exchanged greetings with darkness / comes to spend the night with you. / Long before daylight / he wakes / and, before leaving, kindles a sleep, / a sleep echoing with footsteps: / you hear him going off, measuring distances, / and you throw your soul / after him.""</blockquote><br/><br/>And since <i>Selected Poems</i> was available but <i>Threshold</i> was not, I downloaded it to read... and ""The Guest"" was not in it.","","","","","",0,,,,,

I haven't heard of any other place where one could find this sort of game-oriented programming design advice, and in that respect, this book is unrivaled.<br/><br/>While far from encyclopedic, the chosen design patterns all seem like reasonable choices for video game programmers: there are some architectural ones like <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/flyweight.html"">Flyweight</a> & <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html"">Singleton</a> which everyone needs to know, and then a good helping of high-performance or game-specific patterns (eg. <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html"">Data Locality</a>/<a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html"">Object Pool</a>/<a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/dirty-flag.html"">Dirty Bit</a> & <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html"">Double Buffer</a>/<a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html"">Game Loop</a>/<a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/spatial-partition.html"">Spatial Partition</a>, respectively), as well as a few fairly exotic patterns which often show up in games but not that many other areas (for example, <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html"">Byte Code</a> shows up in a lot of games to support modding, but you'll otherwise spot such things only in a few extremely-extensible applications like text editors or programming languages).<br/><br/>The actual chapters are surprisingly brief (from my non-game-programming perspective, anyway), and come across more as unusually long blog posts than meaty book chapters. Nystrom mentions several times he was trying for brevity, but I would say he's taken simplicity to simplemindedness. I would have liked to see more of everything: more examples, more real-world applications, more benchmarks, more comparisons to other languages (<i>especially</i> to higher-level languages like Python/JavaScript/Haskell, which as hardware resources increase, game programmers will increasingly use; us Haskellers say that design patterns are simply flaws in the language, and I'm curious how much of Nystrom's writing is simply due to working around C and Java issues).<br/><br/>The web presentation is in standard 2.0-style: big font, lots of whitespace. Not too bad for reading, although the sidebar notes were annoying since a lot of them would have been better off incorporated into the text or simply axed, and their relation to the text could be very confusing if there were 2 or 3 on the same page. The web presentation also omits a major advantage of being online: <i>comments</i>! I started reading the site solely because I saw one of the chapters submitted to Hacker News & found it interesting. By a quick count, there's <a href=""http://hn.algolia.com/#!/story/forever/prefix/0/gameprogrammingpatterns.com"">18 relevant discussions on Hacker News</a> and another <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/domain/gameprogrammingpatterns.com/"">37 on Reddit</a>, yet someone reading it has no idea. There were many interesting comments and suggestions in those submissions, why not excerpt the best? Or at least link them at the end of each chapter as a ""further reading"" or something?","","","","","",0,,,,,

In fact, it's a little depressing that we don't seem to have gone much beyond that in the half-century since this was published back in 1945 or so. While at least we no longer need his defense of the unconscious as a meaningful part of cognition, much of the rest is depressingly familiar - for example, his acute observations on mental imagery & people who solely think in words, and mention of Francis Galton's survey (little-known outside of psychology), could be usefully read by many who commit the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/"">typical mind fallacy</a>.<br/><br/>If Hadamard comes to no hard and fast conclusions, but merely raises many interesting points and criticizes a number of theories, we can hardly hold that against him, as we can do little better and so it becomes our failing, not his.<br/><br/>(I read the <a href=""https://archive.org/details/eassayonthepsych006281mbp"">Internet Archive</a> scan.)","","","","","",0,,,,,

This book has all the strengths and weaknesses that this sounds like: on the one hand, these are pretty much all stories I am completely unfamiliar with since the reflections of Venice in things I have read or seen are typically of pre-20 century Venice (think stories like <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> or film works like <i>Aria</i> or histories of the Mediterranean region) and so stories like theaters burning or the Save Venice feuds or the Pound scandal are news; on the other hand, they were news to me because I didn't care about any of them before and I don't care much about them having read <i>Falling Angels</i> either. As one might expect, there's not much cohesiveness to the stories beyond the narrator himself because real life is not so cooperative as to combine all the storylines into a single satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>On the positive side: Berendt is a fine writer who smoothly narrates events and lets people speak for themselves more than most writers would. He is aware of the danger of relying on gossip and seems to keep an open mind as he critically examines all the versions and stories he's told, and he seems to have spoken to everyone so he has plenty to compare. He also has a good eye for details and and interesting people and anecdotes. I don't regret reading it, even if I don't expect to ever re-read it nor learned any 'big' truths or stories.","","","","","",0,,,,,

I purchased a copy of it to look at the novella ""Radiance"" by Carter Scholz and compare it with the full novel <i>Radiance</i> for <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance"">the annotated ebook of <i>Radiance</i></a> I have been working on for a while. That will be its own review, so I will pass over it for now. An unexpected bonus for me was Gregory Benford's contribution: not a story, but an autobiographical essay <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends"">""Old Legends""</a> on the real-life background to ""Radiance"" that he lived through, discussing his physics career, time at LLNL (where ""Radiance"" is set), experiences with other SF authors in the Reagan-era lobbying for SDI/Star Wars, the <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/1984-berger.pdf"" title=""The Astounding Incident: The Manhattan Project's Confrontation With Science Fiction"">Cartmill incident</a>, his admiration of Edward Teller, etc. Scholz clearly drew on Benford for his novella, and so it was unusually interesting for me.<br/><br/>The collection overall is good, but not great. A number of the stories are too clearly the product of early '90s anxious liberalism and have not aged well since they were written in 1993 or earlier (~20 years ago), some are half-baked, and some are just bad. A few are very good. They are grouped into thematic sections. To go through them in order (there are many spoilers below):<br/><br/><ul><br/><li> ""Elegy"", Mary Rosenblum. Good. A scientist working on controlled use of squid neurons to repair human brains and cure trauma like Alzheimer's struggles with guilt about her demented mother, fear her research will fail, and worries that the squid she uses as raw materials may be part of something far greater.</li><br/><li> ""A Desperate Calculus"", Sterling Blake. Bad. World-trotting scientists struggle to organize a response to a devastating pandemic. Twist ending: the pandemic was engineered to render women sterile, stopping the threat of overpopulation, forcing humanity to dieback and live in harmony with the environment, and the (immune) protagonists were spreading it through their jetsetting, overlaid on a geopolitical forecast of Northern hemisphere vs Southern hemisphere balkanization & resentment. The engineered pandemic conceit is nice but has been done many times before, and the politics are incredibly grating. Even in 1994 it should have been obvious that overpopulation was not going to be an existential threat and that the worst of the environmental problems are often solved by additional economic growth (the Kuznets curve). This story is particularly dated; contemporary writers thinking about using global warming as their threat should consider how much they care about dating themselves.</li><br/><li> ""Scenes from a Future Marriage"", James Stevens-Arce. Mediocre. An unlucky couple who screw up all their life decisions fail again, and review their choices while contemplating suicide. Set against a vaguely dystopian background. This one did nothing for me as it was so over the top.</li><br/><li> ""Coming of Age in Karhide"", Ursula K. Le Guin. Great. In an ageless city where every life follows ancient finely-honed patterns, a fearful child grows into its sexual maturity and becomes an adult. This is very much a Le Guin traditionalist story with her trademark gender twist, and it does what it does very well.</li><br/><li> ""High Abyss"", Gregory Benford. Good. An alien religious war about the physics of the universe, in a universe which is not ours, culminates in victory for the renegade mathematician who led the revolt with his heretical theory that the world is not a line, but another topology. A treacherous counterattack sends the prophet aloft on a hot-air balloon and he realizes that his heresy did not go far enough - that the world was a <i>string</i> embedded in a far grander, far larger, more spherical universe (ours?). He is simultaneously exalted and debased by the epochal discovery of the truth of the Universe. Benford throws you in the hard SF deep-end to figure out the universe (I'm actually reminded a little of <i>The Clockwork Rocket</i> here as a recent example). Does it work? It's hard to say because the story is so short. I'm not sure what the ""string"" is even supposed to be - a superstring? How does that work with the given system of the world with 'lava' bubbling up in the center of the world? I thought initially the story was being set underseas on a crustal fault, and the lava was literal lava and the cold abyssal waters doomed the people if they tried to leave the long line/ridge, but then ""stars"" came up and I had to abandon that theory. I'm not entirely satisfied with my interpretation and wish the story had been longer and explained its world a little more.</li><br/><li> ""Recording Angel"", Paul J. McAuley. Mediocre. In a vastly distant post-human future, a Indian-like city's ancient rhythms are disturbed by a human returning from an eons-long space trip. She leads some sort of revolution. Did nothing for me, as nothing about it seemed important, the world-building failed to explain what was going on, etc.</li><br/><li> ""When Strangers Meet"", Sonia Orin Lyris. Bad. A mind-controlling alien (the One) celebrates, with its many servants, the festival at the end of its year, culminating in a grand dance to the death (by exhaustion) of its vaguely human-like slaves. Interspersed are occasional comments about interstellar communication with aliens (humans?). This one frankly made little sense to me. There's some repeated lines about the dangers of the servants becoming ""too familiar"" to the One, but also a line about ""strangers bring benefits"". The story feels ominous but nothing gels before it abruptly ends with the dance performance and another use of the strangers line. What does it all mean? I have no idea. I can barely figure out what the alien social system is supposed to be (I <i>think</i> it's modeled after eusocial insects), much less any theme or message. This might have worked if Lyris hadn't badly overestimated my ability to understand what she wrote.</li><br/><li> ""The Day the Aliens Came"", Robert Sheckley. Very bad. Supposedly humorous. A writer nonchalantly accepts employment with an alien tourist, but then suddenly he's shacking up with another alien, and suddenly the couple is having kids and merging into a group organism with other couples and then the story just ends. WTF‽ This badly needed to be rejected or at least, Bear should have rejected it and sent it back to Sheckley with a note saying ""where's the second half of this story?""</li><br/><li> ""Gnota"", Greg Abraham. Mediocre. A mid-future soldier gets hit by an IED due to sentimentality; his heart is to be replaced by a clone of his heart grown inside a genetically-engineered pig. He bonds with the pig.</li><br/><li> ""Rorvik's War"", Geoffrey A. Landis. Good. A citizen is conscripted into a war against the Russians. He dies in an attack - or maybe he dies another way, and then another. War is hell, and wasteful since the militaries' computers can all simulate the outcome of the battles, except can they really take into account the human factor? Rorvik dies again and again, is taken POW and sent to a Communist re-education camp, until fuzzily he realizes: he's <i>in</i> the computer simulations. He grapples back to reality, and his conscription is over. He returns home with all his limbs, having apparently served his country without any repercussions. But will he psychologically truly recover? I enjoyed this one in part because it undercut my expectations: I was mentally a little bored with yet another war against Russians and thinking it was a little stupid, but then the story justified its choices quite nicely.</li><br/><li> ""Radiance"", Carter Scholz. Great. See <i>Radiance</i>.</li><br/><li> ""Old Legends"", Gregory Benford. Great. See opening summary.</li><br/><li> ""The Red Blaze Is the Morning"", Robert Silverberg. Great. Silverberg turns in one of the best stories in this volume: an old archaeologist, almost out to pasture, strives in his Turkish dig site to make one last extraordinary find justifying his heterodox theory of the origins of human civilization, following the clue of a few out of place artifacts. He is lonely, his body is failing, but his passion to understand the past drives him on in his fruitless digs. Haunted by his continuing failure to find anything at all, he begins hallucinating visions from the end of time, the dying Earth, the ruins of the mightiest civilizations that humanity will one eon give birth to. The visions are sent by his counterpart, one of the last sapient beings left in the ruins after the Gotterdammerung, who makes him an offer: to swap their minds (shades of Lovecraft's scholars), so the being can study the impossibly remote origins of humanity and the protagonist study undreamt-of eras. He refuses of course, and the dig continues to go poorly, he drinks more and more, until finally in the climax, a Turkish official arrives with the shattering truth: the artifacts were planted by a corrupt Turkish official for the express purpose of egging him on and motivating more work at the site. His dig is futile, was always futile, and even the slender evidence he had was meaningless. His theory will not be vindicated. Utterly destroyed by the revelation, he accepts the Faustian bargain and flees into madness - or the future? And awakes at the end of time, with endless ruins to investigate and ponder. This story impressed me as close kin to ""Radiance"" and showing the dark side of a quest for truth.</li><br/><li> ""One"", George Alec Effinger. Mediocre. A husband-wife team set out in a spaceship to search for life. As predicted by the Fermi paradox, they fail to find any on thousands of worlds. The wife dies, the protagonist slowly goes insane, and converts to religion as he continues to fail to find life on any planets he surveys. Wholly unconvincing, I thought.</li><br/><li> ""Scarecrow"", Poul Anderson. Mediocre. An almost Asimovian pastiche, of another husband-wife team whose ship crashes on the chaotic moon Hyperion. They struggle to reach shelter in the installation on the moon, manned by robots, only to discover the robots have, yes, gone insane - or become religious, specifically, having developed a religion focusing on darkness/chaos/bad vs light/order/good. The pair need to prove they follow the light and are not sinister agents of chaos. Based on the wife's brief religious dialogue with the robots, the husband receives inspiration: he proves that they come from the light by teaching the robots about fractals and chaotic equations which nevertheless have a simple beautiful mathematical core. Having proven his theodicy - how a good and orderly god could have created the chaotic Saturn environment - they are accepted by the robots as fellow worshippers and admitted into the base. While I really enjoyed the last page, I level the opposite accusation at this story that I did some of the others: it is far too long, almost all of it could be trimmed out, and some of the characterization is very poor (the wife is wholly unnecessary and IMO is constantly irritating).</li><br/><li> ""Wang's Carpets"", Greg Egan. Great. I would put this with ""Radiance"" and ""The Red Blaze Is the Morning"" as the 3 best stories in this volume. Upload civilization fires off a bunch of copies to remote systems to look for life, in part as a final attempt to find a justification for remaining involved in the real world and pursuing the great scientific project of understanding the universe, rather than enjoying ever more abstracted or refined simulations. They discover an apparently dull giant simple ocean life form based on self-replicating carbohydrate sheets. Egan offers a truly inspired bit of worldbuilding when he suggests the sheets then are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile""><i>Wang tiles</i></a> - which are Turing-complete, surprisingly enough, and so host entire computational civilizations of their own! A wonderfully alien suggestion. This was apparently expanded in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_%28novel%29""><i>Diaspora</i></a>, which if it's as good as the short story, is well worth the reading. I'll look for a copy.</li><br/></ul>","","","","","",0,,,,,

While Kanigel goes overboard in his novelistic scene-setting and psychologizing, one cannot say he does not try to set the scene for one and go beyond a bare recitations of events to the actual feel and texture of life in various places or of various persons; particularly noteworthy is his attempts to explain at least a little of the actual math which made Ramanujan worth a biography, beyond his romantic story, and here I think Kanigel does a really good job for the layman.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Norton & Company","Hardcover","414",2013,2013,2013/08/09,2013/08/09,"","","read","The title might lead one to believe that Fleming is trying to show an inherent duality to science and the Enlightenment in general - its reliance on irrational methods or its oppression or inherent contradictions, say, perhaps an updated (and more factual) Foucault. But while it's a clever play on words, <i>The Dark Side of the Enlightenment</i> boils down to some short biographies of minor figures in Europe: the obscure English faith healer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine_Greatrakes"">Valentine Greatrakes</a>, the French <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsionnaires_of_Saint-M%C3%A9dard"">Jansenists</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism#The_Rosicrucian_Enlightenment"">Rosicrucians</a>, the Freemasons, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cagliostro"">Cagliostro</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_von_Kr%C3%BCdener"">Julie de Kruedener</a>. If one looks for any sort of demonstration of a duality to the Enlightenment, one will be disappointed, as all the examples seem amply explained by simply pointing out that alchemists and religious types and fraudsters have always existed, and the case studies simply show that the Enlightenment did not sweep them away instantaneously, lock stock and barrel; one is surprised to note Fleming's lack of emphasis on the more famous examples of the coexistence of religion & science, like Isaac Newton. Perhaps this is to ascribe a failure at goals that Fleming never aimed at, but regardless none of the sections are particularly compelling: while the Rosicrucian and Freemason sections seem like reasonable overviews of their subjects for people who don't know anything about the topic, Greatrakes and Kruedener left me completely bored and wondering why Fleming considered them interesting enough to write a good chunk of a book on them summarizing other people's books on them, and the Cagliostro section seems rather apologetic (although I have only seen passing references to Cagliostro before and know little about him).<br/><br/>Fleming's medievalist traits show in his resentment for the low modern opinion of the Dark Ages, which is a little amusing, and his predilection for using very old and obscure books as sources. But this is the cause of the best aspect of this book: Fleming's genuine appreciation that even in the Enlightenment, a great many people thought very differently than we do today, centuries later in a completely transformed age, and his attempt to lay out the forgotten background and bring home the difference in consciousness. For example, <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LEW7iWpd4a9"">Fleming points out the absurdity</a> of claiming that Milton either subconsciously or consciously wrote <i>Paradise Lost</i> with the Devil as admirable, given the intense religious convictions of that age and Milton's own strong beliefs, and he does a credible job of conveying how so many Europeans and Catholics could seriously and factually believe that Napoleon Bonaparte was the literal Anti-Christ foretold by John in <i>Revelations</i> who would usher in the end of the world and sketching the <i>gematria</i>-based arguments Christian occultists concocted to 'prove' this. Getting in the ""mind"" of past ages is always hard, and I appreciate any author who gives me a little insight, even if much of the rest of his book left me feeling like I was wasting my time.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Ah! blissful lovers of the future!""</blockquote><br/><br/>As promised, this was a very amusing Victorian novel, an easy read (perhaps a night's worth), and the telegraphs were fascinatingly Internet-chat-like.﻿","","","","","",0,,,,,

They used to be so important, major matters of national prestige, key mechanisms in the spread of art (especially Japanese art, at the Paris one) and technology, and yet, they are completely forgotten; I hadn't even heard of them until they came up in _Men in Black_ because some leftover buildings got used in the movie. But as Larson tells the story, we learn that they were mega-events to which all celebrities attended, and a good fraction of the entire American population would attend; they were the originals of which Disney's Epcot is the palest imitation, they were the reason we have the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel and so many other things. This story is the fascinating story, and it's almost a pity that Larson periodically interrupts the tale of the Chicago one to tell us more about Holmes, rather than giving us real photos and more stories from the fair (photos like those in Appelbaum's _The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record_): after all we are told about the Court of Honor, it's sad to be given only a tiny glimpse of it, and it's really a pity we read only a few 'con stories', as it were, from the event itself.

Dead is dead, and limited wars fought with 1kt neutron bombs which can't affect  much past 1400 meters with minimal fallout sounds way better than dropping megatons on random megalopolises).<br/><br/>He had a seriously messed up childhood if half what he says is true, and one gets the disturbing feeling that he was a hardline right-wing hawk solely because he was beaten up as a kid by some other kids who were socialists, and his language about the War on Drugs is disturbingly emotionally laden and based on purity.<br/><br/>He seems to, like the Bourbons, 'have forgotten nothing and learned nothing' - his memoir might as well have been written back in the '60s, because he shows no awareness of why anyone would consider the War on Drugs a colossal folly, discusses freely how the first Gulf War was a disaster because Saddam could go right back to inventing missiles & WMDs (?! my online edition is dated 2006! Isn't some sort of appendix or footnote or corrigendum warranted like ""oops I completely fucked up my beliefs, sorry!""?), talks paranoidly about Russian intentions and capabilities with almost no reference to post-Cold War developments or revelations which you think he would've been very interested in, and so on. (I don't think much of the _Wired_ editor's appendix either; how does anyone sound 'erudite' when saying a perfectly ordinary sentence on the phone? You sound like you're kissing ass with absurd flattery like that. And the '90s boom wasn't due to the Cold War ending, it was due to Moore's law finally making computers & networks sufficiently cheap & powerful that they were worth a damn for anybody but geeks, etc.)<br/><br/>What is there to like? Well, he has some cute stories about the sloppy studies and research & development which went on back then, like the Minutemen silos which couldn't actually launch any when tested or about Herman Kahn's dishonest scare tactic studies or about the many compromises & sacrifices of intellectual honesty RAND staffers made. Those are fun. The part where he went to France and his explanation for the Vela incident was interesting.","","","","","",0,,,,,

One is strongly reminded of Russell's famous description of Xenophon's writings on Socrates: ""A stupid man's report of what a clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something that he can understand. I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend innocent of philosophy."" Which is not to say that Domscheit's portrait of Assange as a megalomaniac asshole is wrong, because from all the other coverage of him, it's clear there's a lot of truth to this portrayal.<br/><br/>Domscheit's personal failings are only highlighted by the since-complete & unmitigated failure of his 'OpenLeaks' project.<br/><br/>It's also bizarrely lacking in technical details, which is the one part one would hope a supposed geek like Domscheit would at least make sure his book got right! (Probably also thanks to the journalist.)<br/><br/>Still, many interesting bits. I remember thinking way back that for a group claiming so many participants & advisers, it had an oddly low flow of leaks - which Domscheit says was because it was mostly him and Assange; makes sense.

Everything happens too easily - I began worrying as I started the book, there were too many loose ends and nothing set up for a grand ending, and that's exactly what happened. We have the Black Company at the start overpowered as usual, as it has since Smoky started napping, with the further assistance of an even more overpowered demon; they slice through resistance with the greatest of ease, enemies like Soulcatcher or Booboo or Goblin go down trivially, and even the final defeat of Kina comes as trivial anticlimax (how the deuce did it make a lick of sense that the ancient gods couldn't destroy Kina if a little hedge wizard's spear and an exploding airplane can do the trick?!). The 'twist' ending is not shocking or compelling, and my reaction was 'oh. Well, that's nice for Croaker, I guess.' I'm sure there's all good explanations in-universe along the lines of 'the demon was helping them the entire time and eg. that's why the forvalaka dies so easily', but an explanation is just an explanation and it doesn't rescue a bad story.<br/><br/>I'm left just shaking my head, wondering what went wrong. Why did Cook go to such lengths to introduce a character as powerful and hence game-breaking as Tobo while implying a narrative of power-corrupts which never goes anywhere besides one or two instances of revenge? Why did he make the demon so cooperative? Why did he make the Howler die, in what must be the *only* instance in the entire damn series where a Taken dies and stays dead?! And so on and so forth. Reading through some interviews with Cook, I find myself wondering if he just wanted to stop the series and didn't really try hard on the ending - he certainly comes off as cynical and mercenary about writing, with little of Croaker's faith in the power of the Annals. Looking back, many of the books in _The Black Company_ were weak enough that I can't really blame him for intending to stop with the first one, but now that I'm done, I'm not sure I'll bother with any future books in the universe (apparently he has one or two in the pipeline).<br/><br/>Although the title is excellent and used well.","","","","","",0,,,,,

It's also interesting wondering what Croaker is concealing from us, what his sins are: he tells us, the readers of his Annals, that he has concealed a great deal and softened other parts.<br/><br/>The downsides are few since it's a quick read: we see entirely too much of the Company's wizards (how many times do we need to be told that Silent is silent? or that One-Eye has just one eye? or that Goblin gets the better of One-Eye?), and it doesn't do a good job putting any real doubt into our minds about whether the Lady is the least of evils in the North, since she countenances quite a bit and the rebels' sins seem like the usual sort of thing which happens in war and then the wild dogs are put down during peacetime.<br/><br/>Book 2, _Shadows Linger_, was in some respects even better than _The Black Company_. While almost all the Taken are gone and so the scope for plotting has diminished considerably, instead we get a cozy intense little drama set in Juniper, of plotting & murder & corruption with the black castle in the background rewarding & driving it all with its tempting silver as it works towards its own little doomsday (you might call it a collective action problem!). Shed's plot thread is considerably more compelling than Croaker's this time, as we watch him give in to weakness, folly, and bad luck time and again, each time helping the castle grow a little closer to completion and finally triggering an epic battle destroying the entire town and shattering the Black Company. (The focus on the locals also has the benefit of not over-exposing the Company wizards and letting us see them from an 'outsider' perspective to restore their sheen of interest.) While admittedly the black castle is more than a little contrived (the Dominator foresaw his defeat and this was the only countermeasure? the castle took 700 years to mature? he didn't foresee the Juniper death cult before entrusting his last best hope of resurrection to it?), the plot overall still works well, and the creatures of the castle start to give an impression of why allying with the Lady might be a good idea.<br/><br/>Book 3, _The White Rose_, sees it all fall apart. We're plopped on the Plain of Fear at the heart of the renewed rebellion, which is OK enough, and we start learning what happened with Bomanz to release the Lady & the Ten which is even better. But the rebellion is a tawdry little affair, and the plot unengaging. Raven's foolishness is difficult to credit. The White Rose's power is almost too powerful. Parts don't seem to hang together (how do Tracker & Toadkiller Dog arrive *with* Raven's letter if they are only released by his interference?). The final alliance is too easily accomplished. The new Taken are only names. The finale is a succession of deus ex machinas - Father Tree's offspring on top of the silver spike on top of the true effect of naming (if all it takes to destroy someone's powers is to name them, why did this never happen before, and why were we told that true names merely allowed penetrating a magician's spells and defenses?) On top of that, the finale is almost anti-climactic: they dismantle the defenses and neutralize the Dominator using the Rose, and bury him more thoroughly. Oh. Well, OK... The book isn't so much bad, as disappointing since it features none of the intricacy of the previous books, is almost oddly streamlined and 'easy', and takes some easy way outs. I had come to expect more from Cook.","","","","","",0,,,,,

I was really excited when the book was announced, since I hoped for expanded better version of his incredibly interesting paper/monograph <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf"">""Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity""</a> (abstract: ""...In particular, I argue that computational complexity theory - the field that studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve computational problems - leads to new perspectives on the nature of mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of logical omniscience, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction#David_Hume"">Hume's problem of induction</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_and_bleen"">Goodman's grue riddle</a>, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve"">closed timelike curves</a>, and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis.""), and see also his more recent <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1438"">""The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine""</a>.<br/><br/>The book turns out to be excellent, but not the 5-star universally-compelling, suitable for the layman & professional alike, complete coverage of all that is interesting about computational complexity and quantum I was hoping for. I'd say probably that one could get 80% of the value from reading ""Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity"", and even more if one is not particularly interested in computational complexity or quantum computing for their own sakes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- best book I've ever read on computational complexity<br/>- repeatedly throws out fascinating observations<br/>- learned a lot of new things even after years reading Aaronson's blog - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning"">PAC learning</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum%27s_speedup_theorem"">Blum's speedup theorem</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field#Model_Theory:_decidability_and_quantifier_elimination"">Tarski's decision algorithm</a><br/>- humor better than expected<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- some key arguments are sketched out briefly or badly (eg. I don't know how anyone would understand Aaronson's version of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument"">Cantor's diagonal proof</a>, compared to longer better-illustrated versions like Hofstadter's in _Gödel, Escher, Bach_)<br/>- the complex-probability version of quantum mechanics didn't seem much more transparent to me than other versions; maybe if I had a physics degree? (Not that I really understood the 'Quantish' universe in Drescher's equally excellent book _Good and Real_, either.)<br/>- overuse of complexity zoo abbreviations<br/>- no discernible connection to Democritus or the Democritus quote<br/>- some later chapters highly technical and specialized and uninteresting (eg. the size of quantum states), not always meaningfully connected<br/>- Aaronson randomly inserts bizarre and sloppy anti-Bayesian digs - like at the end of his chapter on anthropics, he seems to think it refutes the 'religion' of Bayesianism. Dude, WTF? No one understands or agrees on anyone in anthropics, *that's the whole point of half the field*, and you want to use anthropics as an argument against Bayesianism‽ You want to disprove the eminently successful and practical by the useless and bizarre?

The overall combination is good but nothing to write home about. The frequent appearance of autonomous vehicles is a nice touch and one too often absent from SF, near or far. Most of the technical details were good (I was not surprised to read the short author bio and learn Suarez is a practicing programmer, since the Ross character felt like an author self-insert).<br/><br/>But the decentralized conspiracy was done better in Sterling's ""Maneki Neko"", the creepy persuasive AI was done better in 'Friendship is Optimal', the technical detail in _Cryptonomicon_, the futuristic developments in _Otherland_, and the plutocracy/government stuff in multiple William Gibson novels (Suarez's version being more than a little bit crude - citing _Confessions of an Economic Hitman_, really?).<br/><br/>And despite the lauded technical detail, the AI presented is farcical; it's hard to see how any 'logic tree' could possibly handle all that the AI does even if Suarez throws in some failures to parse responses and writes up .

Levy has information, anecdotes, quotes, and interviews which no one else does, which, like the recent Steve Jobs biography, makes his book indispensable for anyone interested in the topic regardless of the book's other merits.<br/><br/>To continue the Jobs analogy, I *think* Levy is more independent of his subject and more willing to criticize it and poke holes in their narratives - he covers the criticisms I expected, doesn't drop any particularly glaring issues, and more than once undermines their narratives with contrasting quotes & observations. In particular, Page repeatedly comes off as a narcissistic paranoid asshole, possibly due to his father's death, who cannot empathize with others or understand their points of views (a trait perhaps endemic of Googlers, to judge by the Buzz fiasco).<br/><br/>But to compensate for all the great info and explanations (more than once I thought to myself, 'ah, so *that* is what happened!'), there are downsides to the book. The principle one being:<br/><br/>Levy's writing/presentation is extremely journalistic and dumbed down. I'm not sure whether Levy simply doesn't understand programming & computers very well despite his long career covering the tech industry, or if he deliberately treats technical topics simplistically. (A description of JavaScript prefixes it with the undefined buzzword 'dynamic', although dynamic runtime typing is far from the most important aspect of JS; someone writing an early web spider is described as having a break through when they realize they can make it multithreaded, while I'm sitting back and thinking ""there is no way that even in ~1995, any programmer, upon noticing that their web spider was not crawling as many URLs as he needs, would not instantly reach for multiprocessing/multithreading"".) Similar simplisticness applied to the legal discussions as well (you won't come away with a real understanding of all the legal issues at play in the Google Books contretemps), and the economic ones fared much the same (I was glad Levy covered the auction innovations at Google, but couldn't he explain *why* second-price auctions are so elegant and effective?).","","","","","",0,,,,,

I enjoyed the concept and a few touches like the Thule Society, and don't regret reading it: taking blood sacrifice seriously in a ""beware while fighting monsters"" makes for a gradually creeping sense of doom which is fitting, and I was impressed to see the old medieval debate over the language of infants resurrected and then taken to the max, which was a real bit of esoterica. The logical conclusion, a British program into Enochian, is a nasty enough conclusion that it convinced me to keep reading the series.<br/><br/>Downsides: the repeated use of raven sections is blunt; Gretel's character is even blunter, we're told almost on sight that ""she sees the future and is manipulating everyone"" and this is ground in ad nauseam, while subtlety would've worked better (maybe *1* hint at the beginning and then a revelation at the end for the inattentive reader - but we get what must be dozens instead); Nazi Germany is a total caricature; while sometimes the descriptions of places or events are excellent (like the opening), characters can be pretty wooden and I feel like Marsh is made to punch people to move the plot along (eg. to get himself fired, and then to ignore Will and not ask the sane thing like 'why would you suggest something so horrible as an abortion when you know how much losing our child hurt us?'). The alt history is a little crude and lacking in details: in contrast to _Declare_ or ""A Colder War"", which wove in and rewrote all sorts of historical tidbits (some extremely obscure, in _Declare_), _Bitter Seeds_ only does big brushstrokes - tanks going through the Ardennes, bad winter weather in Russia, a failure of a hypothetical Operation Sea Lion - and it omits all sorts of historical backgrounds that could've enriched it (Nazi occultism is a bizarre subject which is surprisingly underused by Tregillis; someone should've given him a copy of _Morning of the Magicians_ or something).

It is an invaluable resource for any researcher, and I felt compelled to create <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs"">an annotated e-book edition</a> in order to elucidate various points and be able to link its claims with versions of stories by other people (for example, <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/1996-animerica-conscience-otaking"">Okada's extensive <i>Animerica</i> interview</a>)<br/><br/>Those reading it solely for <i>Evangelion</i> material will probably be relatively disappointed: Takeda clearly finds NGE not very interesting, may have bad associations due to being targeted in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#tax-evasion-and-the-birth-of-my-daughter"">the tax raids</a>, and he was writing this in 2000 or so - too close to the events and still working at Gainax to really give a tell-all, and it's not a terribly long or dense book in the first place. Nevertheless, NGE fans will still find many revelations here, like the origin of NGE production in the <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#aoki-uru"">failure of the _Aoki Uru_ film project</a> (an origin simply not present in any Western sources before <i>Notenki Memoirs</i> was translated).<br/><br/>In general, Takeda is not interested in a 'tell-all'; perhaps it's due to fear, perhaps too many people involved are still alive and kicking, but he only covers the embarrassing things which are too well-known to omit, like the aforementioned tax raid or <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#okada-leaves-the-company"">Okada's ouster from Gainax</a>.<br/><br/>I read it several times, and that was how I wound up transcribing my copy into a webpage which I could annotate with cross-references and interviews with other figures like Okada or Anno - I realized I could keep rereading it, or just do the job right the first time.

In general, the 'pacing' is quite odd: reams of material on South America, some pages on the Galapagos, a dash to New Zealand & Australia, a long section on islands and 'cacao-nuts' (coconuts), a mini-monograph on coral atolls, and the book abruptly ends.<br/><br/>Which is not to say he doesn't occasionally drop in interesting or acute observations, for he does. (The shepherd-dog of South America quite took my fancy, for example.) They are just rare welcome morsels in the general desert of this door-stopper. If I had to recommend it to my past self, I would tell him to skip the bulk but to read the Tierra del Fuego sections where the events are both interesting and evocative of the long uncivilized past of man (and perhaps his future), the Galapagos section for its substantial historical interest, and maybe the brief conclusion.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>My National Geographic anniversary edition is substantially lacking in additional material; there is surprisingly little about its reception, what contributions it made, where it was prescient and where it was wrong (disturbing, since one doesn't know what mistakes, misimpressions, outdated information, plausible yet wrong speculation, etc. one might be absorbing over the 400+ pages).

Similar to Tad William's _Otherland_ (the fantastic first book _City of Golden Shadow_, not the horrible sequels), Dos Passos's _USA_, or particularly Brunner's _Stand On Zanzibar_ (to which Brin alludes, actually, in having a alien say ""what an imagination I've got."")<br/><br/>The overriding theme is, of course, the Great Silence. Brin's solution, characteristically for a guy who wants to be the ultimate moderate and more moderate than thou, is to take up every solution: the Great Silence is due to more efficient physical transportation *and* memetic viruses *and* Berserkers *and* Lurkers *and* panspermia *and* ecological collapse *and* nuclear war *and*... This is a little impressive to behold, and overall, I did enjoy reading the book. Brin has had a few new ideas since _Earth_ like the smart-mob.<br/><br/>But for the bad:<br/><br/>This jumping makes the book something like a huge primer on the Great Silence/Fermi's Question, yes, but *also* for something of a mess of a book. The book is huge, but a good deal of the bulk is fat and self-indulgent:<br/><br/>1. the dolphin sub-plot is rehashed Uplift material, which only very charitably has any relevance to anything else in the book (I thought that we would at least see them towards the end on spaceships as a token nod toward justifying the time spent on them, but no!)<br/>2. More germane subplots feel incomplete; the autistic kids, ""cobblies"" and the ""Basque Chimera"" form one such oddly underjustified subplot - is this a thing, now, lauding crippled autistic kids as secret savant heroes? I don't know which narrative is more denigrating of the human suffering involved, the standard one or this one. (Autism spectrum may be useful in some areas, but only a *little* is necessary and even the high-functioning often fail: I read in the _New York Times_ the other day that that famous tech firm which uses autistic workers has a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?hpw&_r=0&pagewanted=all"">5/6 rejection rate of applicants</a> just from the start. One must sift a lot of sand.)<br/>3. much material is borrowed from his previous nonfiction or fiction; allusions to _The Postman_ are well and good, but when I could predict the resolution of the Senator Strong mystery from the instant we were told it was an addiction... This also means that I can track how many authorial mouthpieces there are in the novel, and it's pretty much *all of them*. Even people you think are wrong like Hamish are just acting as conduits for Brin's own beliefs. This leads to the severe problem, in a repeated first contact novel, that none of the aliens were remotely alien, and the humans all seemed pretty similar to each other too. It made me wish for Stanislaw Lem, or at least Watts's _Blindsight_.<br/><br/>Brin also has a very weird attitude towards what he calls extropianism but most people these days just call transhumanism. For example, the bogus anti-caloric restriction argument Hamish gives; it is bogus because (a) none of those monks or monasteries are following nutritionally balanced diets, indeed, usually for religious reasons they're following highly unbalanced diets if they're not like the Taoists possibly actively poisoning themselves with mercury, and (b) the records do claim countless instances of extreme longevity, which of course we don't believe because record-keeping was terrible - which means the evidence is so worthless and biased and corrupt that we can't use it to claim the opposite either! I've told Brin this like twice before, not that he cared. But by the time the story is set, the caloric restriction question will be settled: the primate studies will be finished, the human CRers will be dead, and the underlying biochemistry (or lack thereof) will have been elucidated. Suppose he's wrong? He probably doesn't care, he's dead-set against it anyway! I was a little awe-struck when he has his mouthpiece badmouth cryonics, *after saying it worked and there had been revivals*? WTF?<br/><br/>WTF indeed. This attitude could be called schizophrenic. Throughout the novel, Brin seems to struggle with the fundamental problem posed by Vinge: how does he keep the story human given his belief in progress and his basic acceptance of the Strong AI thesis? He never comes up with a good answers, but blatantly hand-waves them away: an emulated rat brain goes critical and escapes into the Internet? Well, uh - nothing happens because I say so (wow, ain't it strange)! There are even more AIs pervading the world, controlling countless key functions? Well, uh - nothing happens because I insinuate something about parents and children and them being grateful! (wow, ain't it strange - ever see a grateful river, spider, tow-truck, computer...? Humans can barely be grateful, ever.) Humanity is a few decades away from a general nanofactory assembler in his story and thousands of crystal probes come to visit? Well, uh - the crystal probes are completely inactive and don't carry nanofactories or *anything* despite it being a mindbogglingly great & evolutionarily fit idea and perfectly doable for them, because I say so and it lets me write adventure arcs with primates fighting over & chucking around glowing rocks! (wow, ain't it strange) He'll mock the extropians in the first part for believing in cryonics or uploads or AIs even though their most-criticized belief, cryonics, has been vindicated 100% in his story even beyond their hopes, their expectations of uploads are equally justified by events towards the end - non-destructive uploading, even! We'd settle for destructive uploads at this point... and so on and so forth. Well, uh - they're right but they're wrong, don't you see! (wow, ain't it strange)","","","","","",0,,,,,

But for me, the most fascinating part of <i>Tombstone</i> was how the vast Chinese government hierarchy rippled policies and misinformation up and down it - how the local cadres tried to bow to the demands they were hearing from higher up, how the higher ups took the falsified statistics and claims often at face value, and how the highest officials in Beijing seem almost childishly helpless as they stagger between skepticism of reports given them and unthinking acceptance of positive results. Mao particularly comes to mind in his constant swerving between ""left deviationism"" and ""right deviationism"" as he tries to get communal kitchens to work and takes at face value the harvest figures and ""sputniks"" (even as in other incidents, he scoffs at a local official, telling him flat out that such yields were simply impossible), as he is flattered by under-officials; despite his information problems, he astonishingly repeatedly engages in tactics of announcing liberal discussion and then brutally punishing anyone who was foolish enough to do aught but flatter Mao and his policies. Indeed, as Jisheng says, officials were placed into a situation of 'slaves to those above, tyrants to those below' (or however his phrase went).<br/><br/>With such perverse incentives, it's no surprise that we run into such perfectly Hayekian examples as 'deep plowing' or 'sputniks' or 'close planting' or the failure of communes to realize any gains of scale (and did realize diseconomies, like the example of how communes needed lumber to fire their large ovens/stoves rather than the little bits of grass individual households could use).<br/><br/>What is surprising is how effective the Chinese government was in maintaining control despite these severe systemic problems. How could so many millions starve to death, and no province rise up in rebellion? How could the revolts be so small scale, when the abuses were so bad and the death tolls large fractions of entire local populations? How did emigration not overwhelm any checks set up? It's easy to agree that Sen is basically right: Mao's famine could not have happened in any country with remotely democratic institutions like India, because the pressure would simply have overwhelmed any coercion the feeble government could orchestrate. But there's also a flip side here: Mao remarks with surprise 'how good' the Chinese people were, that he could summon millions and disperse them with a wave of his hand, and another high official says similarly that it is only the goodness of the people which prevented the Army from being called in. Jisheng is at pains to show that the Communist propaganda worked and the people were not uniformly cynical about the regime like the Russians at the end of the USSR were: many officials sacrificed their careers or lives for their people, high officials are routinely shocked when they return to their home villages, and throughout we see people who are in all seriousness convinced that all the faults stem from local or midlevel officials and if only they can get word to the Emperor in Beijing all will be made well. This naive faith, which initially strikes one as pathetic & moronic & lacking any critical thinking makes me wonder if it could also be related to how China seems to have vastly outperformed India in the past decades, since it switched to sane economic policies; if the Chinese people's faith and hard work could lead to such utter disaster when applied to futile policies, does it yield equally unusual results when finally applied correctly?","","","","","",0,,,,,

It then mixes in a bunch of material on intelligence & genetics, so we might identify an additional subschool: that of Steve Hsu on embryo selection for increasing human intelligence.<br/><br/>Miller succeeds in giving a wide overview of quite a few topics, from Hanson's <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html"">'crack of a future dawn' em scenario</a> to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter"">Great</a> <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html"">Filter</a> to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage"">comparative advantage</a> & the advantages of trade as it applies (and doesn't apply) to AIs to the intelligence orthogonality thesis (that <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis"">intelligence does not imply benevolence</a>) to the logic of arms race and its particularly unpleasant applicability to AI development. And then he tosses in the mentioned intelligence & genetics material, which I was a little surprised to learn from - I had read many of his citations (and actually host a few of the online copies of the papers on my personal site, <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/"">gwern.net</a>), but he still threw in some ones that were new to me.<br/><br/>On a purely factual basis, I have relatively little to fault Miller for. He makes a risible claim about 1700s French life expectancies not hitting the 50s (true only if you include infant mortality, otherwise hitting 50s was perfectly routine - even in the worst tabulations, generally if you made it to 20 on average you would reach the 50s; see <a href=""http://www.hyw.com/Books/History/Fertilit.htm"">0</a>, <a href=""http://lefleurdelystoo.blogspot.com/2008/01/life-expectancy-in-middle-ages.html"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2007pdr.pdf"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.sarahwoodbury.com/life-expectancy-in-the-middle-ages/"">3</a>, <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/07/the-great-escape.html"">4</a>) but he is far from the first to make that mistake; he brings up dual n-back more than once, but he avoids making too many or overreaching claims on behalf of dual n-back such as the increasingly questionable effect on intelligence (see <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis"">my meta-analysis</a>); he seems to criticize people for not taking seriously the method of castration for life extension but doesn't mention the issues with the data and the likelihood that the method would not work post-puberty (ie. for everyone who is able to morally consent to such a procedure). Otherwise...<br/><br/>Otherwise Miller's sins are simply that the writing is merely OK and while he does a reasonable job of, as Hanson puts it in <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/millers-singularity-rising.html"">his own review</a> of _Singularity Rising_, ""explaining common positions and intuitions behind common arguments"", he barely defends them or clearly justifies them. While I and many others involved in the area dislike Ray Kurzweil's theories and arguments and books as being superficial, right for the wrong reason, overly optimistic etc, they do at least do their job of convincing people (and then hopefully they can adopt more nuanced or different views); but though I agree with a large fraction of it, it's hard to believe that anyone could read Miller's book and come out genuinely convinced of pretty much anything in it (as opposed to reactions like ""that's interesting"" or ""maybe""). For example, he does a nice question-answer sequence against the kneejerk bad-philosophy reactions to cryonics, but one could easily bite all the bullets and simply question the incredibly sketchy case he makes (yes, it's great that wood frogs do cryonics all the time, but we're not frogs). He asks that anyone who signs up for cryonics email him about what convinced them - I immediately thought, ""50% odds that no one has done so yet"". (After writing this review, I asked Miller about this and he said no one had yet.)<br/><br/>And aside from as comprehensive a layman discussion of the issues involved in AI economics and technological unemployment as I've ever seen, I can't really name any original contribution this book makes.<br/><br/>I can't say I'm really glad I read it, but then I can't say I really regret reading it (I got a number of IQ-related citations, a discussion of neo-Luddism, and info on the more esoteric possibilities of embryo selection). This is because I already know almost everything in the book and have read many of the citations already, so I am not the target audience; it's good if you want an overview of non-Kurzweilian Singularity ideas and you don't want to read through scores of webpages and papers, and more or less unique in conveying them all in a compact single place - so in acknowledgment of this, I bump my rating up to 4 stars (though for me it was more like 3).<br/><br/>Excerpts:<br/><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/fu11KpSEyyS"">intro-ch3</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QhTNetHGYiA"">ch4-5</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y85Mnxab51i"">ch9</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/XmcubNqP6Nh"">ch10-12</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/1tB6Vt1ERMz"">ch13</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/eRUSF1W1wUq"">ch14-15</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QyLRENKEHft"">ch16</a>","","","","","",0,,,,,

Sowell is not that great a prose stylist and has a gift for putting things in ways that irritate the hell out of me even when I already agree with him.<br/><br/>More importantly, the promise of the flaps and introduction is *not* borne out as far as I read. It was not an investigation, either psychological or historical or economic, of intellectuals or recent intellectual history. It was simply a partisan rant bringing up all the old arguments and citations we've seen a million times before; I give him points for thorough - dare I say, intellectual - sourcing, which is more than one can say about eg. Michael Moore or Ann Coulter's books (he wrote, damning with faint praise).<br/><br/>There are arguments in it which I find hard to believe would pass Sowell's own muster if they were dressed up in liberal guise.<br/><br/>For example, on pg27 I was shocked to see - in the middle of his haranguing liberals for insufficient attention to economics - him *seriously* argue that oil company executive salaries are irrelevant because they add only a dime to the cost of gasoline gallons! Wow! Imagine Sowell's reaction to the following argument: ""regulation XYZ is not worth debating about because, after all, when implemented it will add no more than a dime to the cost of gas"" - can there be any doubt that he would rip this argument to little eeny-weeny shreds for failing to 'think on the margin' and realize that an extra dime will make or break many economic decisions and ramify throughout the economy? How was it possible for him to write such a transparently partisan thing? Because it was a good bash at his enemies.<br/><br/>('Politics is the mind-killer', as we say on LessWrong.)<br/><br/>Or another example from pg21; having finished reciting the Hayekian argument that no one can generalize over the entire economy or populace and central planning is impossible, he then goes on (???) to discuss how Cicero told his friend all English slaves were completely worthless and how Teddy Roosevelt hated all Indians and rather than criticizing their opinions as a perfect example of the intellectual's arrogance in generalizing from tiny tiny samples (both Cicero and Teddy were intellectuals par excellance), he *defends* their bigotry, arguing that critics are themselves being arrogant! What is this I don't even -<br/><br/>It came as no surprise on pg28 to see a caricature of economic libertarianism and zero mentions of standing disproofs of the simplistic models like Coase's point about large firms being economic absurdities and central planning in a different disguise, since I wasn't expecting very much any more.<br/><br/>By pg30, I abandoned my sporadic note-taking and began playing a little game: write down every time a thinker or politician who could be described as conservative or libertarian is criticized or given as an example of the evils of intellectualism.<br/>Naturally, I didn't expect to see Hayek come up for hobnobbing with dictatorships (any more than people discussing Mother Theresa usually bring up her more questionable funding sources), but still - an entire book ought to provide at least 1 or 2 examples.<br/><br/>In the 70s or 80s, I thought I might *finally* have something to add to my list: Naziism and Italian fascism. Surely those would get criticized, as they notoriously aimed to remake their entire societies, with disastrous results? But no! I learned, to my surprise, apparently fascism and Naziism are socialist liberal parties and they are just more liberal examples of intellectual arrogance!<br/><br/>Apparently no one on the right end of the political spectrum has ever proposed or implemented any bad idea, ever. Even if I granted the fairness and accuracy of all his descriptions of left-wingers, his conclusions or synthesis would be completely worthless as it omits half the political spectrum! It would be like doing a study of cancer patients and throwing out every patient who was a Democrat - what could you possibly hope to learn at the en, after you did that?<br/><br/>The Naziism-is-socialism finally broke me. Writing a bad review is not so worthwhile as to be worth going through this. The book was nothing but capsule hitjobs of everyone Sowell disliked at any point, and gave no indication that it would be anything but that for the entire rest of the book.<br/><br/>Life is too short to read Sowell, and I had Charles Murray's _Coming Apart: The State of White America_ to read, which I've been looking forward to reading for a long time.","","","","","",0,,,,,

It feels inhuman, mechanical, and all the more so when you know that these sort of policies *were* how the Qin crushed all their opposition - including those states espousing the other Hundred Schools of Thought like Mohism & Confucianism - and that the 20th century affords further examples of how these policies proved themselves in practice (unlike the former Schools).<br/><br/>It's no wonder that there are so many negative reviews on the other copies here at Goodreads: you might as well ask your normal liberal Western to drink rat poison as read _The Book of Lord Shang_ & try to fairly evaluate it. Even if they've read their share of Chinese classics & philosophy, they wouldn't *want* to understand it, just like modern readers don't *want* to understand the Unabomber's philosophy.<br/><br/>(The version I read was an <a href=""http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/duyvendak_jjl/B25_book_of_lord_shang/duyvlord.rtf"">ebook version of Duyvlord</a>.)","","","","","",0,,,,,

He is constantly killing and being attacked, wenching his models, contracting hideous illnesses (or noting in passing the constant unexpected death of others), and being betrayed (by this account) or insulting others. It's an endless exhausting cycle such that even Cellini had to notice its futility and danger. One has to wonder how much he exaggerates: aside from the demonology and weather-controlling, it seems so routine for people to go around armed and attacking for minor insults and then dying of a scratch. Then there is his strange attitude to his patrons: on the one hand, he seems largely unable to criticize them or the system despite wallowing in their corruption and wealth (surely the King of France wasn't all *that*, and given the sheer servility & ignobility & criminality of the popes he deals with, his tolerance of them is astounding), but on the other hand, he almost goes out of his way to mess with them.<br/><br/>Well, it's fun in small doses, the constant tumult of Cellini's life suggests that the constant murder & assault & theft & large gifts we read of in picaresques or stories (like the _Decameron_) are much more realistic than we give them credit for, and it's pretty cool to look at the Wikipedia article and see images of the works he labors over at such length in his autobiography.","","","","","",0,,,,,

To go through it roughly in order:<br/><br/>1. the first few chapters are a serviceable philosophy of science primer. We get discussion of how the Scientific Revolution was a break, we get some Popper and falsificationism, and as a very important correction, some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis"">Duhem-Quine</a>; we get some cultural and vocation material, and discussion of the value of prediction even in non-experimental sciences. Chapter 6 is a bit of a waste as Manzi makes the standard criticism of frequentism that the basic ideal - probability as the limit of some particular set of events - is extremely imprecise since it gives absolutely no guide as to *which* set of events, since you can choose arbitrarily complicated events, but he does so on his own terms and without any reference to competing paradigms such as the many flavors of Bayesianism.<br/>2. then we get into genuinely important material on the development of RCTs (he uses the term ""RFT"", which I find silly). Personally, I could wish for a whole book on the gradual development and refinement, and many more examples of the superiority of RCTs to other approaches; his summaries of things like the US social program experiments is short and in many ways inferior to, say, <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/1987-rossi"" title=""The Iron Law Of Evaluation And Other Metallic Rules, Rossi 1987"">Rossi's ""metallic laws""</a>. ch9's example analyses read like columns folded into the chapter, but I still enjoyed them as fun examples of critical thinking and how analyses can reach any goal.<br/>3. with ch10 we finally get into Manzi's own career. This section is... weirdly lacking in many examples, even though it's the section where you would expect Manzi to just lay the smack down with countless scores of anecdotes and stories and statistics about how experimentation is the _ne plus ultra_ of epistemology and exactly how much money it made all these corporations. There's a few, like Capital One and some Internet companies, but it is not very thematically separate from point #2.<br/>4. he issues some policy recommendations. Hard to argue with some of them: why not let in some immigrants as part of randomized experiments? It can hardly be worse than the current system. Fairly anodyne.<br/><br/>So overall good, and maybe great for people who aren't familiar with the topics. But I think in general if I wanted a layman to appreciate statistics and its pitfalls and experiments, I might actually be better off giving them Nate Silver's _The Signal and the Noise_ (although they're not totally comparable, of course).<br/><br/>People seem impressed by his Hayekian libertarian arguments using genetic algorithms as arguments. I don't think they're as well supported as they may seem. Just to name the obvious, society has changed massively over short time-spans, corporate mortality is astonishingly high, corporations do not replicate with high fidelity (""corporate culture"" is fragile) etc; evolution, as it happens, can only filter out <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16152.long"" title=""'Protein stability imposes limits on organism complexity and speed of molecular evolution', Zeldovich et al 2007"">so many</a> <a href=""http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002609"" title=""'Mutation Induced Extinction in Finite Populations: Lethal Mutagenesis and Lethal Isolation', Wylie & Shakhnovich 2012"">mutations</a> per generation so past a certain point, a genome just decays. This, along with <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/l6/no_evolutions_for_corporations_or_nanodevices/"" title="" No Evolutions for Corporations or Nanodevices"">other considerations</a>, strongly suggests that corporate 'evolution' is nothing but a poetic metaphor.","","","","","",0,,,,,

I see complaints online that 'Streets' is an unfair caricature and reveals Harrison's stock atheism, but it's hard to lay out the world, story, maintain a decent style, and also be subtle or fair in just a few pages), but that's a price I'm willing to pay. Also on the downside for a modern reader, Harrison shared the common SF preoccupation with the 'population bomb' and coming Peak Oil/great dieback; neither of which seem to have happened, thankfully, but they still irritate one to read just a little bit.<br/><br/>Hence, I couldn't give this a 4 or a 5, but I don't regret reading it since some were pretty good and I did laugh while reading some. So a 3 it is. RIP, Harrison.","","","","","",0,,,,,

If this were TvTropes, it'd be an entry on the Idiot Ball page. One almost wishes Bakker had Moenghus take responsibility, because at least then it would make *some* sense.) The conquests become lackluster after book 2.<br/><br/>The only redeeming aspect is that Paul becoming Padishah Emperor sets us up for _Dune Messiah_ - sorry, I mean Kelhus becoming Aspect-Emperor sets us up for _The Judging Eye_, which has more intrinsic interest.","","","","","",0,,,,,

38276,"The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T.","Stewart Brand","Brand, Stewart","",="0140097015",="9780140097016",3,"4.04","Penguin Books","paper","304",1988,1987,2010/01/01,2012/07/21,"","","read","While a well-done bit of technological investigation & prognostication, now very dated & historical. That said, enough time has passed since 1988 to enable us to judge the basic truthfulness of a lot of the predictions and expectations held by the dreamers such as Nicholas Negroponte: and they were <i>remarkably accurate</i>!<br/><br/>If you aren't struck by a sense of déjà vu or pity when you read this book, just compare the people at the Media Lab with contemporary skeptical works like Cliff Stoll's <i>Silicon Snake Oil</i>, and you'll see just how right they were. <br/><br/>But the sad thing is noting how few future millionaires and billionaires grace the page of TML - one quickly realizes that yes, person X was absolutely 100% right about Y happening even when everyone thought that was insane, but X was off by a few years and jumped the gun and so Z was the person who wound up taking all the spoils. I read it constantly thinking 'yes, you were right, for all the good it did you' or 'not quite, it'd actually take another decade for that to really work out'.<br/><br/>""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" The lesson I take away from TML is that it is not enough to predict the future, one has to predict the timing as well to not be ruined. To borrow from 3 of my LW comments (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/e6j/the_brain_preservation_foundation_still_needs/8tny"">1</a>/<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/h5x/bitcoin_cryonics_fund/8qew"">2</a>/<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/453/procedural_knowledge_gaps/8rap?context=1#8rap"">3</a>):<br/><br/>Even if one is wise enough to know the future, a good idea will draw overly-optimistic entrepreneurs to it like moths to the flame: all get immolated but the one with the dumb luck to kiss the flame at the perfect instant. (How many payment startup were there before Paypal? How many social networks before Facebook? How many search engines before Google?) How can you catch a falling knife?<br/><br/>Many 'bubbles' can be profitably interpreted as people being 100% correct about their vision of the future - but messing up the <i>timing</i> (see <a href=""http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5646"">Thiel's article on China and bubbles</a> or <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21575737-lessons-americas-long-history-property-booms-betting-house""><i>The Economist</i> on obscure property booms/bubbles</a> or Garber's <i>Famous First Bubbles</i> for further reading). Consider the case of an investor in the ill-fated <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com"">Pets.com</a>: was the investor right to believe that Americans would spend a ton of money online such as for buying dogfood? Absolutely, Amazon (which has rarely turned a profit & has sucked up far more investment than Pets.com ever did) is a successful online retail business that stocks thousands of dog food varieties, to say nothing of all the other pet-related goods it sells. But the value of Pets.com stock still went to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2000/11/16/1116simons.html"">~$0</a>. Many startups have a long list of failed predecessors who tried to do pretty much the same thing, and what made them a success was that they happened to give the pinata a whack at the exact moment where some cost curves or events hit the right point. (Facebook is the biggest archive of photographs there has ever been, with truly colossal storage requirements; could it have succeeded in the 1990s? No, and not even later, as demonstrated by Orkut & Friendster, and the lingering death of MySpace.) You can read books from the past about tech visionaries and note how many of them were spot-on in their beliefs about what would happen (<i>The Media Lab</i> is a great example, but far from the only one) but where a person would have been ill-advised to act on the correct forecasts. Or look at computers: imagine an early adopter of an Apple computer saying 'everyone will use computers eventually!' Yes, but not for another few decades, and 'in the long run, we are all dead'.<br/><br/>Examples of this pop up all the time. I watched impressed recently as my aunt used the iPhone application FaceTime to videophone with her daughter half a continent away, and though about how so many people were disappointed by the failure of videophones in the '90s and previous and then concluded that perhaps people didn't <i>really</i> want videophones at all - but really, it looks like the videophones back then simply weren't good enough! And I've noticed geeks express wonderment at the Oculus Rift looking like it'll bring Virtual Reality to the masses, and won't that be a real kick in the teeth for Cliff Stoll or Jaron Lanier (who gave up VR for dead ages ago and has earned his daily bread being court jester to the elites and criticizing them)?<br/><br/>Smartphones are an even bigger example of this. How often did I read in the '90s and early '00s about how amazing Japanese cellphones were and how amazing a good smartphone would be, even though year after year the phones were jokes and used pretty much solely for voice? You can even see the smartphones come up again and again in TML, as the visionaries realize just how transformative a mobile pocket-sized computer would be. Yet, it took until the mid-00s for the promise of smartphones to materialize overnight. I was reminded of this recently reading an interview with <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/17/an-interview-by-eric-jackson-on-blogging-apple-and-whats-next/"" title=""My thanks to Eric Jackson for his thoughtful questions and post on Forbes.com."">Eric Jackson</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>Q: What’s your take on how they’re [Apple] handling their expansion into China, India, and other emerging markets?<br/><br><br/>A: It’s depressing how slow things are moving on that front. We can draw lines on a graph but we don’t know the constraints. Again, the issue with adoption is that the timing is so damn hard. I was expecting smartphones to take off in mid 2004 and was disappointed over and over again. And then suddenly a catalyst took hold and the adoption skyrocketed. Cook calls this “cracking the nut”. I don’t know what they can do to move faster but I suspect it has to do with placement (distribution) and with networks which both depend on (corrupt) entities.</blockquote><br/><br/>Certainty is irrelevant, because even if you are certain you still have serious problems making any use of this knowledge. Example: in retrospect, we know for certain that a great many people wanted computers, operating systems, social networks etc - but the history of computer / operating system / social networks are strewn with flaming rubble. Suppose you somehow knew  in 2000 with absolute certainty that ""in 2010, the founder of the most successful social network will be worth at least $10b""; this is clearly a sharp falsifiable belief which was at odds with all conventional wisdom and about a tech that blindsided a lot of techies, and so is a powerful & informative belief. Yet, just how useful would this knowledge be, <i>really</i>? What would you do with it? Do you have the capital to hang out a VC shingle and throw multi-million-dollar investments at every social media thing that comes along until finally in 2010 you knew for sure that Facebook was the winning ticket and could cash out in the IPO? I doubt it.<br/><br/>It's difficult even to invest in stocks. There is no convenient stock named CMPTR you can just buy 100 shares of and hold indefinitely to capture gains from your optimism about computers. IBM and Apple both went nearly bankrupt at points, and Microsoft's stock has been flat since 1999 or whenever (translating to huge real losses and opportunity costs to long-term holders of it). If you knew for certain that Facebook would be as huge as it was, what stocks, exactly, could you have invested in, pre-IPO, to capture gains from its growth? Remember, you don't know anything else about the tech landscape in the 2000s, like that Google will go way up from its IPO, you don't know anything about Apple's revival under Jobs - all you know is that some social network will some day exist and will grow hugely. The best I can think of would be to sell any Murdoch stock you owned when you heard they were buying MySpace, but offhand I'm not sure that Murdoch didn't just stagnate rather than drop as MySpace increasingly turned out to be a writeoff. In the hypothetical that you didn't know the name of the company, you might've bought up a bunch of Google stock hoping that Orkut would be the winner, but while that would've been a decent investment (yay!) it would have had nothing to do with Orkut (awww!); illustrating the problem with highly illiquid markets in some areas...<br/><br/>And even when there are stocks available to buy, you only benefit based on the specifics - like one of the existing stocks being a winner, rather than all the stocks being eaten by some new startup. Let's imagine a different scenario, where instead you were confident that home robotics were about to experience a huge growth spurt. Is this even nonpublic knowledge at all? The world economy grows at something like 2% a year, labor costs generally seem to go up, prices of computers and robotics usually falls... Do industry projections expect to grow their sales by <25% a year?<br/><br/>But let's say that the market is wrongly pessimistic. If so, you might spend some of your hypothetical money on whatever the best approximation to a robotics index fund you can find, as the best of a bunch of bad choices. (Checking a few random <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Robotics_companies"">entries in Wikipedia</a>, maybe a fifth of the companies are publicly traded, so... that will be a pretty small index.) Suppose the home robotic growth were concentrated in a single private company which exploded into the billions of annual revenue and took away the market share of all the others, forcing them to go bankrupt or merge or shrink. Home robotics will have increased just as you believed - <i>keikaku doori</i>! - yet your 'index fund' suffered huge losses or gone bankrupt (reindex when one of the robotics companies collapses? Reindex into what, exactly? Another one of the doomed firms?). Then after the time period elapses and your special knowledge has become public knowledge, the robotics company goes public, and by the Efficient Market Hypothesis, their shares then become a normal gamble where you could lose money as easily as make it. So you could easily fail to outperform the general market.<br/><br/>(Is this an impossibly rare scenario? Well, it sounds a lot like Facebook, actually! They grew fast, roflstomped a bunch of other social networks, there was no way to invest in them or related businesses before the IPO, and post-IPO, I believe investors have done the opposite of profit.)<br/><br/>It feels like a weird perspective to take, but we can think of many other technologies which may be like this.<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a topical example: it's still in the early stages where it looks either like a genius stroke to invest in, or a fool's paradise/Ponzi scheme. We see what looks like a bubble as the price inflates from ~$0 to $130 as I write this, which is consistent with the claims of it being a bubble - yet, if Bitcoin <i>were</i> the Real Deal, we would <i>expect</i> large price increases as people learn of it and it directly gains value from increased use, an ecosystem slowly unlocking the fancy cryptographic features of it like all the kinds of smart contracts it enables, etc. <br/><br/>Or take niche visionary technologies: if cryonics was perfectly correct in principal, yet turned out to be worthless for everyone doing it before 2030 (because the wrong perfusion techniques or cryopreservatives were used and some critical bit of biology was not vitrified) while practical post-2030 say, it would simply be yet another technology where visionaries were ultimately right despite all nay-saying & skepticism from normals but nevertheless wrong in a practical sense because they jumped on it too early, and so they wasted their money.<br/><br/>When a knife drops, a fraction of a second divides a brilliant save from an emergency-room visit. They don't call it the 'bleeding edge' for nothing.","","","","","",0,,,,,

711592,"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy","Adam Tooze","Tooze, Adam","",="0670038261",="9780670038268",4,"4.36","Viking Adult","Hardcover","832",2007,2007,2014/05/07,2012/07/20,"","","read","A fascinating account of the economic transformation of Germany under the Nazis, the repression & distortion of the German economy, the strategic confusion & ignorance of their best options revealed by shifting armament priorities (such as the underemphasis on tanks & overemphasis on surface ships), the difficulties imposed by exchange rates, how often Germany teetered on the brink of disaster, and how Hitler's constant focus on the danger of the American juggernaut guided his grand strategy; Nazi Germany's militarization based on debt induced competing arms races / instability an the country quickly (and only temporarily) became the deadliest shark in the European waters, which had to desperately keep swimming forward & taking insane gambles if it was not to choke to death on its own accumulated wastes & bad decisions, in the hopes that it could eat all its enemies before they woke up & ate it, and while the shark got a reprieve in Austria and then the freak victory in France, it eventually hit a wall in Russia and died after thrashing around for a while.<br/><br/>Tooze's account of WWII explains many otherwise baffling points for me, such as the focus on futuristic weapons or why Nazi Germany sought an alliance with Japan even at the cost of declaring war on the USA & striking FDR's shackles, why it invaded the USSR with less than an ultimate effort, and the economic consequences of its conquests (predictable to anyone who's read Tainter's <i>The Collapse of Complex Societies</i>). Particularly surprising is Tooze's description of how impoverished Germany was in comparison to rival countries (despite the gleaming technology and Blitzkrieg we associate with Nazi Germany, and the industrial conglomerates like IG Farben with Imperial Germany, most of Germany was still rural & unproductive, and the country abjectly dependent on imports to maintain its agriculture; Tooze includes a very telling anecdote: Ford Motors, when considering a plant in Germany, found that to give its blue-collar American workers their accustomed lifestyle would require expenses 4x that of normal blue-collar German workers; and horses will feature repeatedly throughout). Tooze also does a good job delineating how the Holocaust both exacerbated and helped with the severe labor & resource problems Nazi Germany began facing, and covers how it was a logical outcome of earlier policies: emigration failed because the German balance of payments did not allow for the Jews to leave with anything like their actual wealth, and unsurprisingly many Jews were not so fearful as to emigrate penniless, and starvation in camps was not far from the earlier Wehrmacht plan to make the conquest of the Ukraine pay by simply starving to death 30 million Slavs to free up food harvests. Indeed, given all the constraints and necessary imports in the 1930s and 1940s, one really has to wonder how contemporary Germany can be so wealthy and whether it really is due to labor reforms or thanks to the Euro...<br/><br/>One flaw is that Tooze freely goes from macro to micro, from the overall economy to very small subindustries or benchmarks, and it's easy to get lost. And while the book covers the international finance in enough detail to understand it (and things like why Schacht was the 'dark wizard of international finance'), I don't think he does as good a job as <i>Lords of Finance</i>, which should probably be read before <i>Wages of Destruction</i> so one understands the international gold standard, and the French and British actions in the inter-war period.","","","","","",0,,,,,

25781,"The Iron Dragon's Daughter","Michael Swanwick","Swanwick, Michael","",="0380972336",="9780380972333",4,"3.74","Avon Books","Hardcover","424",2012,1993,2014/06/02,2012/07/20,"","","read","I read it based on <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/kan/june_2014_media_thread/ayhg"">Anatoly Vorobey</a>'s review:<br/><br/><blockquote>""This is fantasy for adults: complex flawed characters, a world rich in detail, multitude of characters who live and do things for their own sake rather than to advance a plot point or help the hero. Utter disregard for conventions and cliches of the genre. A hero who is an anti-Mary Sue. Endless inventiveness of the author. To my taste, this novel is what books like <i>The Kingkiller Chronicles</i> promise, but then utterly fail to deliver. But if you're a fan of Rothfuss, try Swanwick anyway, and you might get a fuller and richer taste of what you like.""</blockquote><br/><br/>I liked it a lot after I got through the initial section in the factory, which was over-the-top Dickensian enough to make me wonder if it was worthwhile. But it got better, and began unfurling into a mad Victorian/fantasy cross, heavy on the social oppression & economic exploitation, reminiscent of China Miéville's bourgeois imperialist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Crobuzon"">New Crobuzon</a>. The plot breaks down into a few discrete chunks of the protagonist Jane's life, which while highlighting the ruthless nature of life in a universe where the gods are real (the homecoming queen being sacrificed may be horrifying, but the consequences of not sacrificing are even more dire, as one memorable nihilist character makes clear; and our own society does not hesitate to sacrifice lives for its own ends, as with, say, coal-burning power plants) also highlight her cowardice and selfishness in betraying her friends instead of... what? We're not too clear, as the world begins melting and things get weird in an <i>Invisibles</i> or Dick-style turn towards radical ontological uncertainty. (The dragon, incidentally, appears in far less of the novel than one would expect from the title.)<br/><br/>This may sound tedious, but Swanwick really does throw all sorts of fascinating little twists in along the way that keep one reading: malls where time literally stops so you can shop to your heart's content; factories with 'time clocks' that age one if one doesn't clock out; live gargoyles, with all the food requirements flying stone entails; a man who shrinks in his wife's regard for being a coward until he's the size of a homunculus & is trapped in a jar begging for death; markets in entertaining slaves among the <i>eloi</i> upper-class elves; magical engineers who are castrated to ensure they do not damage the magics they work with; academics who assault the castles of the gods in the quest for knowledge, and get burned; universities with purges that are literally decimating... Still, it's a happy ending, I think. Swanwick puts it amusingly in <a href=""http://www.michaelswanwick.com/revan/idda.html"" title=""The Elf Lord, the triune Goddess, and Jane's dilemma (Caution - Spoilers)"">a page of explanations</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>I gave her T as a reward for making it through to the end of the novel he's the one worldly thing she wants - and, quite to my surprise, the Goddess threw in K as well. What happens next? Does Jane marry T and keep K as best friend? Does K steal T from her? Do they all fall into bed together? This one I really don't know because the real reward I gave Jane for making it to the end of the book was freedom. I ran across Carol Emshwiller just after she finished writing <i>Ledoyt</i> and she said she was in mourning, that all these people she had lived with for years were suddenly gone and it felt as if they'd all died. ""Doesn't it feel that way to you, too, when you finish a novel?"" she asked.  I thought about it. ""No,"" I decided. ""It feels like all these characters who have suffered under my persecuting hand have been set free. I imagine them running joyfully in all directions, as hard and fast as they can, so that I can never catch them and put them in another book again.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway, going over some of the parts of it which amused me while I was reading... You know your fantasy is grim and imaginative when astrology is due to educational corruption:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Hello? I was sent here for remedial?"" The pale man looked up. He nodded wanly. Unhastily, without emphasis, he picked up a book, opened it, paged forward a leaf, and then back one. ""There are three stars in the heavens,"" he said, ""moving about Jupiter, erratic sidereal bodies which establish a lesser zodiacal process for that wanderer in its mighty twelve-year progression about the sun.""...""Excuse me,"" she said hesitantly, ""but what effect do these minor planets have on our behavior and fortunes? I mean, you know, astrological influence?"" He looked at her. ""None.""""None at all?"" ""No."" ""But if the planets affect our fortunes—"" She stumbled to a stop at the dispassionately scornful look on the pale man's face, the slow way he shook his head. ""Surely you'll agree that the planets order and control our destinies?"" ""They do not."" ""Not at all?"" ""No."" ""Then what does? Control our destinies, I mean."" ""The only external forces that have any influence on us are those we can see every day: the smile, the frown, the fist, the brick wall. What you call 'destiny' is merely a semantic fallacy, the attribution of purpose to blind causality. Insofar as any of us are compelled to resist the flow of random events, we are driven solely by internal drives and forces."" Jane seized on this last. ""Then what you're saying is that our fate lies within us, right?"" He shook his head. ""If so, it must be extremely small and impossibly distant. I would not suggest you put any reliance in such an insignificant entity.""'...She waited, but he did not elaborate. ""In introductory astrology they told us that each person has a tutelary star and that each star has its own mineral, color, and musical tone, and a plant as well that is a specific for the disease that is caused by that star's occultation."" ""All untrue. The stars do not concern themselves in the least with us. Our total extinction would mean nothing to them."" ""But why?"" Jane cried. ""If it's not true, why would they teach it to us?""A dry fingertip tapped the page not impatiently but pedagogically. ""All courses require textbooks, charts, and teaching aids. By the time the information codified as astrology was discredited and became obsolete, it had a constituency. Certain...personages benefit from the supply contracts.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Nihilist the plot may seem to be, but it's leavened with some sharp satire; for example, bureaucracy in the factory:<br/><br/><blockquote>At last, late in the day, the inspector general arrived. A wave of dread preceded the elf-lord through the plant. Not a kobold or korrigan, not a spunky, pillywiggin, nor lowliest dunter but knew the inspector general was coming. The air shivered in anticipation of his arrival. A glimmering light went just before him, causing all heads to turn, all work to stop, the instant before he turned a corner or entered a shop. He appeared in the doorway. Tall and majestic he was in an Italian suit and tufted silk tie. He wore a white hard hat. His face was square-jawed and handsome in a more than human way, and his hair and teeth were perfect. Two high-ranking Tylwyth Teg accompanied him, clipboards in hand, and a vulture-headed cost analyst from Accounting trailed in his wake.</blockquote><br/><br/>School:<br/><br/><blockquote>After Grunt had called attendance, he cleared his throat. ""The Three B's,"" he said. ""The Three B's are your guide to scholastic excellence. The Three B's are your gold key to the doorway of the future. Now—all together—what are they?"" ""Be-lieve,"" the class mumbled. ""Be-have. Be Silent."" ""What was that last?"" He cupped a hand to his ear. ""Be Silent!"" ""I caaaaaan't heeeeear you."" ""BE SILENT!"" ""Good.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>It was only when she went to empty out her locker that Jane realized how overgrown it had become. Orchids and jungle vines filled most of the space within and a hummingbird fled into the corridor when she banged open the door.</blockquote><br/><br/>Consumerism:<br/><br/><blockquote>It was a scorcher outside, but the mall was kept so cool that Jane was sorry she hadn't brought a sweater. The place was jammed with fugitives from the heat. They were recreational rather than serious shoppers, most of them. Their hands were empty and their eyes were clear.</blockquote><br/><br/>College roommate strife:<br/><br/><blockquote>""The dissection manual?"" Monkey asked airily. ""I ate it."" ""You what?"" ""I ate it. Why else would I want it? I was hungry and I ate it."" ""But I need it for class.""""Then you shouldn't have given it to me."" Monkey's beady eyes glittered strangely, maliciously, in her round face. ""Really, Jane, you can be so dim at times."" With a sudden standing backflip she disappeared through the doorway. Jane's hands clenched. But really it was no more than she had learned to expect. Roommates were forever eating your books, having anxiety attacks, adopting rats and carnivorous slimes which they then expected you to feed, getting drunk and throwing up on your best dress, moving into the closet and refusing to come out for months on end, threatening suicide the night before Finals, leaving piles of rotting leaves in the middle of the floor, entertaining boyfriends in your bed because it was made and theirs not, evolving into large bloodsucking insects. Monkey was actually good of her kind. Well, she could always pick up a new manual.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>Monkey snatched the pencil from her hand and snapped it in two. Jane closed her eyes and traced the sigil of Baphomet with her inner vision. When she was calm again, she slid open a drawer.""All right."" There was a pair of latex gloves within. ""I wasn't going to do this."" She pulled them on. ""But you don't exactly give me much choice, do you?"" Credit where credit is due, Monkey didn't back down. There was a touch of the trickster in her heritage, and the trickster gene was a dominant. She licked her lips nervously as Jane pretended to lift an invisible box from the drawer. ""You don't scare me."" ""Good."" Jane swung a hinged lid back and reached within. ""It works best if you don't believe."" She removed an equally imaginary scalpel and held it up between thumb and forefinger, admiringly turning it one way and the other. ""What are you going to do with that?"" Jane smiled. ""This!"" She slammed her fist into Monkey's stomach.</blockquote><br/><br/>Academia:<br/><br/><blockquote>""I have been going over your laboratory reports, Miss Alderberry."" Dr. Nemesis put an arm through hers, and walked her toward the front. ""They are, if I may confide in you, disappointing, most disappointing in a student of your potential."" ""I've been having trouble with the sophic—""...""You must surely realize why I am concerned for you."" ""Well..."" Jane didn't really, but that double glare bored into her, waiting for an intelligent response. ""I'm here on a merit scholarship, so I suppose—"" ""No!"" Dr. Nemesis stamped her foot impatiently. As if in response the elevator door slid open. She steered Jane outside. They were on an office level now. The walls were decorated with large unframed oils of umbrellas and sides of beef. The runners on the hall floors smelled new. ""I am not talking about mere money, but about your very survival! This is a Teind year, surely you must know that."" Jane nodded, meaning no. ""The department heads are even now assembling the list of those ten percent of the students who are... expendable. Your name, Miss Alderberry, is going to be on that list unless you straighten up and fly right."" She glared at her: weakly, sternly.<br/><br/>...""What set me straight was one particular incident. My adviser, none other than the wizard Bongay himself mind you, had obtained grant money from the Horned Man Foundation to create a divinatory engine in the form of a brazen head. This was, you will understand, very early in the history of cybernetics. It was all done with vacuum tubes then...Then he saw how the head glowed and how the solder ran in little rivulets from the seams in its neck and with it the gold and silver of its circuitry. Then did the wizard Bongay himself scream, in such fury that I fled for fear of his wrath."" She laughed. ""He lost tenure over that incident, and his life as well. That happened near the end of the fiscal year, and the University had been relying on that grant money. Everybody involved with that fiasco was executed by order of the Bursar."" ""How did you survive?""<br/>""They needed somebody to write the final report.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>The University library opened its doors at midnight and closed at dawn. The rationale given for such extraordinary hours was that they discouraged dilettantes and idlers from wasting the library's facilities.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>Even for the School of Grammarie, which was widely held to have pushed the concept of liberal arts to an extreme, Professor Tarapple was grotesque. A burnt and crisped cinder of a creature was he, blackened and small, his limbs charred sticks, his torso rendered, reduced, and carbonized. His mouth hung open and his step was slow and painful. He seemed a catalog of the infirmities of age. He felt for the microphone. His hand closed about it with a soft boom, then retreated. The charred sockets of his eyes rose toward the ceiling. Jane realized that he was blind....Professor Tarapple groped for a laser pointer, leaving sooty handprints on the lectern top. He directed the pointer toward the slide with motions as jerky and unconvincing as a rod puppet's. The red dot of light jiggled off to the side of the screen. ""This is—"" The head wobbled. ""This is—is Spiral Castle itself."" Nobody so much as breathed. ""No one but I myself has ever delved so deep into the Goddess's mysteries. The Ocean above which it is suspended is Time itself, and so far as could be determined with our limited instrumentation extends to infinity in all directions. Next slide.""...Jane was having a hard time following the lecture. The harsh white image of Spiral Castle was like a magnesium flare. It swelled and dwindled in her vision, as if softly breathing. Her eyes pulsed, aching when she tried to follow the logic of its involutions. She had to look away...""Toadswivers! Curly-mounted bobtail jades! Codheaded pigfuck bastards!"" With a start, Jane came to herself. Throughout the auditorium, the audience members were rousing themselves. A Teggish professor directly before Jane's seat straightened with a lurch and a snort. A gnome to her left passed a hand over his mushroom-spotted pate. Professor Tarapple had abandoned his lecture in a rage. He was berating his audience. ""Only one being—one! me!—has ever delved so far into the Goddess's secrets and returned to talk of them. By cannon-fire, holy water, and bells, listen to me! I risked more than life and sanity to bring you these photographs. I—I—I was once young and tall and handsome. I had friends who died in this expedition and will never be reborn. We were caught and punished and punished again. I alone escaped. Look at me! See the price that I paid! So many times I have tried to tell you! Why do you never listen?"" He was weeping now. ""Woe!"" he cried. ""Alas for those who seek after Truth, for such is the Goddess's most hoarded treasure. Ah, she is cruel and unfathomable, and bitter, bitter is her vengeance."" The lights came gently up. The applause was thunderous.</blockquote><br/><br/>One of the parts towards the end which particularly reminded me of <i>The Invisibles</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>""One time, passing through the Carolinas somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M., Jerry and I picked up a white Lotus with two blonds in it. We honked and waved. They gave us the finger and put the pedal to the metal. I did the same, of course, but even with dual carbs it was no contest. We had a muscle car but they had a sex machine. They made us eat their dust....Ten-fifteen miles down the road we saw the Lotus in a Roy Rogers lot. We pulled in for some take-out burgers. There they were. We struck up a conversation. When we left, Jerry-D went with the driver of the Lotus. Her friend went with me...Anyway, there I was, a blond in pink hot pants rubbing up against me. I had my foot to the floor, her tongue in my ear, and her hand down my pants. I pushed up her halter top and squeezed her breasts. The air shimmered with the immanence of revelation. Little Richard was singing 'Tutti-Frutti' on the radio and it somehow seemed significant that what I was hearing had been electromagnetically encoded, transmitted as modulated radiation, reconstructed by the radio as sound, and only reinterpreted as music somewhere within the dark reaches of my head. I felt then that the world was an illusion - and a rather shabby one at that, an image projected upon the thinnest of membranes, and that were I to push at it just right, I could step out of the world entirely. I unbuttoned her shorts. She wriggled a little to help. I slid my hand under her panties. I was thinking that everything was information when I found myself clutching an erect penis. I whipped my head around. The blond was grinning wildly into my face. My hand involuntarily tightened about her cock. Her hand tightened about mine. They might have been the same hand. We might have been one person twinned. The car was up to about 100 mph. I wasn't even looking where we were going. I didn't care.<br/>It was in that instant that I achieved enlightenment.""</blockquote><br/><br/>And finally, the gargoyle passage. It's too long to quote, but I've posted it at http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=HDrLMfQj","","","1","","",0,,,,,

He is good enough to make a number of specific predictions... pretty much all of which are wrong.<br/><br/>For example, he predicts that post-WWII that the military would expand massively and form a real faction as opposed to a little 'puddle' (right) and that officers would enter the governing elites and change the composition of the ruling classes (wrong; Eisenhower was elected president, but there is no visible change in composition - few presidents or candidates have benefited from service, and contenders like Colin Powell or Wesley Clark have either not run or sunk like a stone. Congress remains a province of lawyers, and no one gets wealthy in the military until they take the revolving door), and further that his loosely defined Bonapartism is inevitable although I do not recognize Clinton, Bush, or Obama as being very Bonaparte-like figures.<br/><br/>On pg259-260, he presents a doozy of ""scientific statements about social matters"":<br/><br/><blockquote>...Thus we now may know, with considerably probability, that: if the state absorbs under centralized control all major social forces, then political liberty will disappear; if, after this war, Europe is again divided into a considerable number of independent sovereign states, then a new war will begin in Europe within a comparatively short time; if the present plan of military strategy (i.e., submarine attrition warfare, and ""island-hopping"") continues unchanged in the East, then Japan will not be definitely crushed for many, many years, and perhaps never; if the present Administration plans to remain in office after 1944, then it will have to curtail political liberty further; and so on.</blockquote><br/><br/>These statements were published in 1943, well *after* such events as the Battle of Midway (June 1942).<br/><br/>About the best I can say is that charitably, the counterfactual precondition for one may not have been true (if we assume 'Administration' refers to FDR, and not his Vice President, Truman, who succeeded FDR on his premature death and then was re-elected with no visible brownshirts stuffing pollboxes). The rest are simply embarrassing. The science of politics must indeed have been young... (Or perhaps there's some other common thread to the political criticism that opens and closes the book. Always a problem with authors discussing deception.)","","","","","",0,,,,,

Indeed, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/fzy/notes_on_psychopathy/"">some attempts at treatment</a> have backfired and resulted in even more crime being committed by subjects.","","","","","",0,,,,,

The story is hampered also by the relatively low amount of documentation (one wonders what the boxes of documents Newton burned would have revealed).","","","","","",0,,,,,

Norton & Company","Hardcover","334",2010,2010,2013/06/29,2012/07/19,"","","read","Hilarious, eye for details, incessant curiosity, good at tracking down bogus stories and rumors. Roach comes up with all the best quotes and stories, seems to have talked to everyone and done everything. And her running commentary is also hilarious - she's almost as funny as she thinks she is. I laughed many times reading the book.<br/><br/>This is definitely more ""mind candy"" than educational as it jumps from food to sex to hygiene to acceleration issues to psychology without any overview or unifying ideas or concepts, although I did learn a fair bit anyway from the scattershot approach. (One chapter was a revelation for me in explaining why <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Sand#scanners-live-in-vain-as-realistic-sf"">early science fiction</a> often postulated space driving people insane). If there is any big picture to _Packing for Mars_, it's that outer space is *really* hard for humans to survive in and everyone & everything has to be studied in microscopic detail for anyone to go there and come back alive. Reading all the checks and modifications and details, one is boggled that we made it to the Moon, much less we be musing a Mars mission.<br/><br/>(It makes for a pretty compelling argument that humans just don't belong in space and that if we put half as much effort/time/money into automated exploration, we would know far more about the universe than we do - apparently, the ISS has cost us <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Programme_cost""><i>$150 billion</i></a>‽ Roach is aware that this is the impression she gives in her conclusion where she criticizes 'simulations', but honestly, I didn't find it a very compelling defense of the enormous difficulties & costs of shooting up some monkeys to walk around Mars compared to just sending probes.)<br/><br/>I compiled some excerpts from most of the chapters:<br/><br/>- chapters <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/jmWazbnemdz"">1-2</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/UygTUTr6JxN"">3</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/TCXnbJPsM4f"">4-5</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ri2n4YzMNkf"">6-7</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/5YfPihkd2Bz"">8</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/EZBkXDcU1Zs"">9</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/cALb6LEWKx8"">10</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ksf8iYRutuL"">11</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/BD5TZJTbwtE"">12</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LRBW1xsM2HU"">13</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y3UUadXni7i"">14-15</a><br/>- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/A3UtFXZbZtn"">endnotes</a>","","","","","",0,,,,,

Throughout were revelations to me - just how ruinous WWI was, how reparations kept echoing and damaging Germany, how exactly the hyperinflation started (it was only partly the Versailles payments but more the social programs?), how America aggravated the issue (the Coolidge quote and the American tourists certainly never appeared in my history textbooks...), how late the stock bubble was and the details of the endless succession of crises that rocked Europe. It's also interesting to understand why Keynes had such a grip on economics until recently: he predicted repeatedly what would happen, and it's hard not to sympathize a great deal with him.<br/><br/>As far as criticism goes, I can agree with some of the other reviewers: Ahamed sometimes goes overboard with the narration, and skimps on the details one might want. He provides no convenient graphical network of how factors affect each other in a gold economy, so one is left constantly being surprised by connections, and the rare graph is not very helpful - for example, he provides a time graph of the big economies' rises and falls in growths, and remarks that their recoveries in the Great Depression... and nowhere on the graph marks for each country the year in which they left gold! Well, that graph wasn't very informative or helpful - Tufte would not be pleased.<br/><br/>Applying it to modern times is a little harder, although the ironies are many (particularly the Germans being hardasses on debt now, when they seemed to understand not all debts could be paid after WWI... -_-). One thing that struck me was how the nationalist demonstrations & protests in Germany reminded me of what I hear in *China* these days - which has a somewhat similar per capita GDP as those nations and is in a similar period of industrial growth, and indeed, is the young turk of Germany to the old tired island-nation England of Japan, with South Korea as a nervous smaller neighbor (France?). And China is quite aggressive lately. Before WWI, it was rightly pointed out that such a war between such networked nations as France/Germany/England would lead to ruin; and right now, one could point out a similar thing with China/SK/Japan/USA. But nevertheless, before WWI, they thought they could have a short victorious war against an encircling enemy; does China think it can have a short victorious war against their encircling enemy, the USA-coordinate nations? I don't think it does, but I do think people underestimate the risk of war in East Asia. (Of course it could never happen; just like WWI could never happen.)","","","","","",0,,,,,

Overall, <i>Light</i> is a huge disappointment given the glowing reviews given of it by the likes of Neil Gaiman and previous work of Harrison I've read like <i>Virconium</i>: occasional flash of inspiration in worldbuilding, excellent writing in parts marred by flat descriptions, repetition (particularly anything to do with K-ships), and some deeply questionable approaches to depicting sex.<br/><br/>The three stories come together and intertwine only by a very generous reckoning (the Kearney arc is uniformly awful and a waste of space, especially the shaggy-dog-joke of an ending, making me wonder if Harrison was trying to one-up Banks's <i>Wasp Factory</i> and completely failing) and a healthy dose of authorial fiat for a lamely inept ending, the space-cyberpunk is derivative and much inferior to other works like <i>Schismatrix Plus</i>, the allusions are random and superficial (adding little depth or layering, unlike, for example, many works by Dan Simmons).<br/><br/>Halfway through, I began wondering if maybe I was simply not getting it, if <i>Light</i> was simply '2deep4me'; but the ending confirmed that nope, I understood fine - there was just that little going on underneath the flashy surface.","","","","","",0,,,,,

It was wildly different in tone and subject matter from most of the EU, I didn't know whether I hated it or loved it, and it seemed to have been largely ignored by the rest of the EU (ever see the Yevetha or Black Sword Command or the White Current mentioned elsewhere?). This ignoring has happened for a number of other books like the _Dark Empire_ comics or _Crystal Star_, but usually for good reasons: _Dark Empire_ was so over-the-top and gothic that to take it seriously would undermine many other stories and so it's usually name-checked briefly, if that, and ignored, while _Crystal Star_ was just so terrible it can be ignored. Neither of these seem especially applicable, though, so I didn't know what to think.<br/><br/>Having reread the trilogy now, I think I understand it better. It's essentially a Weber/Drake/Clancy-style military or mil-sf novel, which happens to be set in the EU and feature 2 distracting large subplots. From the great opening Fifth Fleet exercise to the equally great small subplot of discovering the Black Sword records (I'm nerdy enough to really like that, and also the various library/research issues in the Lando subplot) to the excellent finish, that's what it really is.<br/><br/>The problem is in large part the non-Yevethan subplots:<br/><br/>1. there's a reasonably interesting first-contact story using Lando which keeps distracting from the real story and which has absolutely no relevance to the other 2 subplots and is completely unnecessary. (Another reviewer comments that it would fit nicely as a stand-alone story like the pulpy _Han Solo Adventures_; I agree, and actually there were multiple _Lando Calrissian Adventures_, so even more reason...)<br/>2. The subplot for Luke has more justification than Lando, but is still problematic for how sheerly boring and pointless it is. The ultimate justification seems to be the White Current assistance in the final battle and revelation of how they had been working against the Yevetha all along, but this is not much of a justification. It's probably just as well, since any real info about Luke's mother would have been rendered moot by the prequels (and I wonder if that's why the ending *had* to be so disappointing?). The positive side is that in some respects, this subplot seems to anticipate how a lot of later writers would handle Luke - so perhaps we should not criticize Luke's hermetical ways and musings. (Some of the resemblances to the Yuuzhan Vong/New Jedi Order story-arcs are striking, although I hated them enough that I stopped reading the EU after they started coming out.) Certainly he serves as a vehicle for some interesting bits like reflecting on the death toll of the first Death Star (although the Imperial Museum in _Wedge's Gamble_ is still a far better scene).<br/><br/>(One missed opportunity is Drayson; since Drayson is a key player in the major arc, and a key player in the start and end of Lando's arc, the trilogy missed a chance to make an interesting and subtle move: have Drayson be the topic of the trilogy! It would examine his methods, choices, and beliefs as contrasted against those he manipulates and serves. Most people would not appreciate this subtlety, but that only makes it mirror the life of its subject all the more. But he plays no role in Luke's subplot, so the interpretation fails. Too bad. The spy novel aspects were a major reason why Zahn's trilogy was, and probably still remains, the greatest EU series.)<br/><br/>The criticism of Leia in the trilogy is, I think, off-base. A good character is not a omni-perfect automaton who never makes mistakes; Leia needs to make mistakes, and this depicts one of them. Calling that 'bad characterization' is just fanboyism. I am reminded of a foreword to one of the character encyclopedias which enthused, ""Check it out, Leia never misses [in _A New Hope_]"". I did. She does, several times.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Banks is a great author, so of course there are plenty of rewarding nuggets scattered through out (the haunted ex-Culture man, the deceptive artifact, the general convincingness of 'the stage is small but the audience great' theme etc.), but much less than expected from a groaning tome's worth of Banks. The shell world concept is not developed or employed well (you could replace all of the maneuverings with 2D equivalents if you wished), and the rest of the background and concepts seem pretty stock Culture.<br/><br/>† eg. I was expecting the betrayal to be linked to alien machinations, but no, it turns out to be exactly as simplistic as it seems, the ex-SC guy's good argument to the contrary, and a complete red herring as he dies with everyone else, the complexity of his character never ascending beyond cackling evil.","","","","","",0,,,,,

(One exception is the discussion of APRs and how the loans actually are done which renders them far less usurious.)

He cites Tocqueville approvingly on the lack of coherence of the narrative of the French Revolution with the observed facts that the French had never had it better than before the Revolution - but how can I then have any confidence in any of *his* narratives?","","","","","",0,,,,,

Advanced as in <i>not working yet</i>. Mission as in <i>continued funding</i>. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip Quine deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.<br /><br/><br/>The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its managers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conversations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign and inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control.<br /><br/><br/> More than a critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, <i>Radiance</i> is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationships are just a question of who's using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. ""Spin"" is a property not of atomic particles but of the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources. It is a world which language is used to evade, manipulate, and expedite. It is a world where everyone's story is always open to revision and language is used for justifying everything from defense programs to divorce.</blockquote><br/><br/>Years ago, I ran into a book review titled <a href=""http://ltimmelduchamp.com/node/84"">""'Its awful and enticing radiance': The Beauty and Terror of Carter Scholz's <em>Radiance</em>""</a> by L. Timmel Duchamp; about a 2001 novel I had never heard of by an author I had never heard of, but it sounded interesting and I read the review until towards the end, it quote a key passage in <i>Radiance</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>A murmur of rain had started again. He lay there in the abyss of his thoughts as her breathing beside him steadied and deepened. Almost a voice stirred in him. It starts before Hanford, it almost said. It starts with Röntgen, with the piece of barium glowing in the path of invisible rays, striking out the fire that God had put there. It starts with his wife's hand on the photographic plate, its transparence there, the ashen bones visible within the milky flesh. Who could imagine that this radiance at the heart of matter could be malign? That with its light came fire? (Yet from the first the ashen bones were there to see within the flesh.) It starts with Becquerel carrying the radium in his pocket that burned his skin, and darkened the unexposed film. It starts with Marie Curie poisoning herself in that pale uncanny glow. With Rutherford guessing at this new alchemy, guessing that matter, giving up its glow, transformed itself one element into another. With the miners at Joachimsthal, deep under the Erzgebirge, inhaling the dust of uranium and dying of ""mountain sickness"". With women who by the thousands in watch factories tipped their brushes with that glow, touched it to their tongues before painting the dial face, women who only much later, when the watches' glow had faded, sickened and died from that radiance taken into their bones. It begins with Ernest Lawrence rushing across the Berkeley campus, the idea of a proton accelerator uncontainable in his mind, calling out, I'm going to be famous! With Oppenheimer at Jornada del Muerte that morning of Trinity. With the scientists who had prised open the gates to that blazing realm past heaven or hell. What were they now at the Lab in all their thousands, but the colonial bureaucrats of that realm, the followers and functionaries, the clerks and commissars? Mere gatekeepers of that power. Or in its keeping. It goes of its own momentum beyond Hanford, to Trinity, to Hiroshima, to the prisoners, the cancer patients, the retarded children, the pregnant women injected or fed this goblin matter to see would it bring health or sickness, the soldiers huddled in trenches against the flash, bones visible in their arms through closed eyes, staring up at the roiling cloudrise, the sheepherders, the farms, the homes, the gardens downwind. And in his sleep the voice long stilled spoke once more. It starts with Sforza; <i>in case of need I will make bombards, mortars, and firethrowing engines of beautiful and practical design. It starts with Archimedes focusing the sun's rays upon the fleet at Syracuse, it starts with the first rock hurled by the first grasping hand. It starts where we start. It is mind, it is hunger, it is greed, it is defense, it is mischief, it is the devil, it is the god; it is life.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The force of the incantation struck me and a few years later, a copy finally appeared in my local library system. I requested it and devoured it in one or two sittings; Scholz's favored punctuation-less style, using hyphens for voice transitions, annoyed me (but did not challenge me - I'd already read <i>Stand On Zanzibar</i> & Dos Passos's <i>U.S.A.</i>). The swirl of references drenched the work in reality - Scholz seems to know everything about everything, from philosophy of science to the L5 Society to Wagner's <i>Parsifal</i>, but the themes were grand and ones 'modern literature' so often fails to address and cedes to science fiction: the role of science in society, the tension between future gains and present losses, what is corruption, whether we live up to our own standards, the worth of truth...<br/><br/><br/>You could only call it a satire if you didn't realize how closely it all tracks to real events: it is a roman à clef of the Star Wars program, down to the nuclear tests which intrude onto 5 pages in the final section. (Scholz seems to have drawn heavily on <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends"">Gregory Benford's autobiographical essay ""Old Legends""</a>, included in the anthology the ""Radiance"" novella was first published in.)<br/><br/><br/>The novel begins in media res, depicting a failed exorcism of the government labs, quickly turning to its protagonist, a good-natured but despairing and baffled Quine's attempts to understand his predicament: in charge of designing a nuclear weapon where the data simply disagrees with the theory which is supposed to be right. The story unravels into one of deception and funding pressure, and Quine triumphs, unseating the culprit in it all, and realizing he doesn't belong at the labs - ""I belong inside!"" he says, even as he is forced out in the turmoil of anti-nuclear protesters.<br/><br/><br/>A hallmark of <i>Radiance</i> is the Gibsonian sense of alien entities and organisms clashing for life, at a level above individuals: the Labs has generated its own culture, with its own imperatives and loyalties and goals, fed by government money, but in this respect, we can say little better of the continual antagonist of the labs, the protesters, as it is its own alien entity, seeking funding for its protests (funding, Réti reminds us, comes from the enemy), subverting Lab members for information, pressuring characters like Lynn to serve it. And it doesn't end there: the Pentagon lurks in the background, represented by Reese, quietly pushing along research into ever better nuclear weapons, and hinted at twice are foreign governments like North Korea, and beyond that? Here I borrow a term from Kevin Kelly and refer to the Technium: science and technology regarded as its own entity with its own drives and selection effects, including the proliferation of all forms of technology.<br/><br/><br/>Section two turns to the unseated Highet: his ouster, and the epilogue of his story as he looks over the ruins of his life and seeks out a final resting place in a think-tank. The Biblical and Wagnerian overtones are strong in this section. Thinking of <i>Parsifal</i>'s Grail quest, it's hard not to remember that only one knight finds the Holy Grail in the end: the others all go astray or have sinned in various ways.<br/><br/><br/>Section three completes the work. Just like <i>Dune Messiah</i> thoroughly subverted and undermined the simplistic narratives presented for the reader to swallow in <i>Dune</i>, part three shows the reader how Quine in his own turn is fully subverted by the environment, his sense of duty, and yes, his own belief in the desirability of progress. (""He goes right to the point and carries the reader / Into the midst of things, as if known already; / And if there's material that he despairs of presenting / So as to shine for us, he leaves it out; / And he makes his whole poem one. What's true, what's invented, / Beginning, middle, and end, all fit together."") The imagery and parallelism at times is not even subtle: for both Quine and Highet, Scholz arranges for them to at some point limp (just like Edward Teller) and have inflamed reddish faces - the implication could hardly be clearer if one of the characters had been named 'Faust' and Lynn Hamlin renamed Margaret Hamlin.<br/><br/><br/>And finally, having been 'corrupted' (but having succeeded in securing the future of the National Ignition Facility which runs to this day), Quine is dealt the final blow: the revelation of the leak of nuclear test data. The Technium strives toward openness and proliferation. Technology may be amoral but it has imperatives of its own. The book ends in Quine in despair and granted a moment of lucidity: seeing his entire life as a mixture of success and failure, as but a pawn of vast forces beyond his comprehension, beholding the presence of the ghostly Technium, far from exorcised.<br/><br/><blockquote>...he stabbed the radio to silence as the dash blinked JAM and he accelerated into the next lane with the needle climbing past 80 past 90 when the CD player blinked PLAY and a falsetto whined, --gonna be just dirt in the ground --Damn it! Shut up...! banging the dash as his wheels trilled on the raised lane dividers and a horn snapped his head around to the panicked face of another drive too close as he yanked the wheel and the road slid on despite his foot wedged on the brake and the yank of the wheel back against a fishtailing swerve into a chorus of horns and gaping faces traveling sideways past him until the car came up hard against a curb and stopped. He was on the shoulder turned sideways. Through the passenger window he saw traffic rush toward him and pass behind him. Ahead of him, smoke rose from fields of stubble, and a flight of bird, scattered by some disturbance, wheeled, now black, now white, against the empty burning sky.<br/><br/>In the heart of that light, lucid and inevitable, all that was scattered cohered. Superbright and all its progeny stood plain before him in conception and in detail and in its component part and its deepest strategies and in its awful and enticing radiance. He saw the design and the making of that device complete, and of further devices without end, and he stood apart from them as if it mattered not at all whether the deviser was himself or whether they came into being sooner or later. Trembling he stared across the burning fields and whispered, --Stop. Stop. But the traffic rushed on.</blockquote><br/><br/>The 3 sections form closed circle: a tight ball of historical forces, corruption, science, despair, progress, failure, and personal tragedies.<br/><br/><br/>The reader expecting further satire will not be pleased by this section. They've missed the point: this isn't a comedy, it's a tragedy. And what would a tragedy be without there being a great gap between what we hoped a character might accomplish and what actually happens? The higher they can fly, the sadder a crash.<br/><br/><blockquote>Coyote, First Angry, enemy of all law, wanderer, desert mind, outlaw, spoiler, loser, clown, glutton, lecher, thief, cheat, pragmatist, survivor, bricoleur, silver-tongued Taliesin, latterday Leonardo, usurper Sforza, adulterer Lancelot, tell, wily one, by any means, of the man with two hearts, of knowledge and desire safely hidden from each other. Did not Paracelsus command us to falsify and dissimulate so that ignorant men might not look upon our mysteries? Did not the noble da Vinci hide the meaning of his thought by the manner of his script? What man has not two masters, two minds, two hearts? Tell of the man so wounded in himself that he tore his second heart from him and cast it out, naming it the world, and swore to wound it as it had wounded him.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not as simple as 'good' and 'evil'. It's not even as simple as 'corruption' vs 'honesty': look around. Progress is not inevitable. Athens declined. Florence declined. Countries fall. Knowledge can be lost (look at scurvy). Science is not a formalized process, but a spirit of honesty and inquiry, which can be aped and the wordless teaching lost (how can Japanese or Chinese researchers run hundred of experiments, apparently complying with all known standards, every single one of which concludes acupuncture works, when results elsewhere show dramatically lower success rates?). After WWII, many Americans saw the ruins of Germany and Japan, and took to heart a lesson: the darkness waits. Anti-vaxxers to our left, Creationists to our right. And that's in America, still preeminent in science, still one of the wealthiest countries in the world - based on just that science & technology. Highet is not wrong - just one-sided.<br/><br/><br/>(""If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"")<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the book, we know ""the work goes on"". Another of Scholz's references, this time to alchemy's <i>magnum opus</i>, the philosopher's stone, which grants moral purification, eternal life, and the transmutation of base elements into nobler ones. (Transmutation has been realized as radioactive decay, while modern medicine would astound Bacon, and it does not seem absurd that in the next few centuries mankind will cure aging.) The double aspect pops up again, of fraud and greatness: research as practical work but also as spiritual quest. Another double aspect: alchemists were notorious scam artists & mountebanks, tricking others (particularly secular lords and governments) into funding their researches based on tricks with gold - but Isaac Newton was an alchemist, Robert Boyle based modern chemistry in part on the knowledge painfully gleaned by centuries of alchemists, and the formation of modern states was due in part to gunpowder (Chinese alchemists), and Roger Bacon, who I cannot resist supplying <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ln/resist_the_happy_death_spiral/"" title=""Eliezer Yudkowsky"">an apt quote about</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>""Once upon a time, there was a man who was convinced that he possessed a Great Idea. Indeed, as the man thought upon the Great Idea more and more, he realized that it was not just <i>a</i> great idea, but <i>the most wonderful idea ever</i>. The Great Idea would unravel the mysteries of the universe, supersede the authority of the corrupt and error-ridden Establishment, confer nigh-magical powers upon its wielders, feed the hungry, heal the sick, make the whole world a better place, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br/><br/>The man was Francis Bacon, his Great Idea was the scientific method, and he was the only crackpot in all history to claim that level of benefit to humanity and turn out to be completely right.""</blockquote><br/><br/>It starts with Bacon...<br/><br/><br/>But the traffic rushes on. And the work goes on.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Even when you think it's done on Mt Ararat (and Powers has in a final flourish explained Philby dying shortly before the Berlin Wall), the plot isn't entirely over and there are multiple more deceptions and operations to go. And to top it all off, Powers takes an afterword to <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork"">""show his work""</a> and reveal how Cold War history was <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction"">""freakier than fiction""</a> (in TvTropes terms), but it's hard to blame him for not being really pleased with some of the genuine incidents he works in.

That's... not a good way to either demonstrate Bayes is good in history nor to convince people of his overarching claims like 'all correct historical inference is Bayesian inference'.<br/><br/>The way to introduce a new paradigm is to start with its *successes*, where Bayesian methods led to a correct prediction or retrodiction of an issue where decisive evidence surfaced while before the issue was settled, conventional methods were confused, wrong, or underconfident; and *then* argue that its practical success combined with your philosophical arguments about Bayesian reasoning being the only correct reasoning is a convincing synthesis, maybe then work out verdicts/predictions/retrodictions on a non-controversial area so the experts can see how they like the conclusions, and only *then* extend it to highly controversial and difficult (scarce or low-quality evidence) material.<br/><br/>I understand how he would come to write it that way since that's what he was paid to do and Biblical material has become his specialty but I can still regret that the outcome wasn't as good as it could've been.","","","","","",0,,,,,

I've rarely read a book where the main protagonists inspires such disgust in me - even for a picaresque, the main character Ignatius is extreme. It is as if Toole read Cleckley's _Mask of Sanity_ and a psychology textbook, and said to himself, ""how can I make the most offensive moronic character which mashes up the traits of both psychopaths and autists?"" and then wrote a novel on it in which the protagonist's countless evil actions, glib lies, narcissism, ignorance, sloth, leeching, and other flaws finally brought down an appropriate punishment - only to rescue him at the last moment for further adventures.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm not bothered that Ignatius pretends to be a medievalist Catholic. I'm bothered that as far as I can tell, Toole seems to genuinely try to present Ignatius as educated and learned and with a worldview (and reading the reviews here, it seems that most people do indeed take this for granted). The problem is, Toole fails. Utterly. In the entire book, Ignatius's learning is displayed solely as repeated surface allusions to Boethius and Hroswitha, and a few other dropped names, and never anything of substance. Someone who read Wikipedia on Boethius and Hroswitha would know more than Ignatius does, and is probably literate enough to spot Ignatius (and by extension, Toole's) failures, like writing 'gyro' where they were trying to make an allusion to Yeats's 'gyre' (way to mess up an allusion to only one of the most famous poems ever!).<br/><br/>So, with the complete failure of Ignatius to offer any sort of Catholicly-grounded interesting critique or reflection on society (as a good picaresque is *supposed to*!), we're left with the evocation of New Orleans (seems good enough, although I don't know enough about New Orleans to really judge), the humorous value of each set piece (overall, low. Jeeves this is not.), and the final convergence of plot threads at the bar (a decent enough denouement but still leaves the first 150 pages a drag).<br/><br/>Is that enough to make it a masterpiece? I should think not. Indeed, _A Confederacy of Dunces_ overall stands in stark contrast to Gene Wolfe or R.A. Lafferty's better novels.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Overall, far more interesting than I had expected. Surprisingly funny or interesting anecdotes. There is a superfusion of gods and oracles, which was curious - the oracles truly were treacherous! The Persian kings come off as remarkably capricious and destructive, even the good ones. And Herodotus has a strange capacity to skeptically reason well & sensibly and then be completely superstitious in the next passage. Having read about these ancient events many times, I found half the value was just seeing a thorough account from a single Greek's perspective.","","","","","",0,,,,,

1294428,"Urne Burial","Thomas Browne","Browne, Thomas","",="0141023910",="9780141023915",5,"4.12","Penguin Books","Paperback","128",2005,1658,2012/07/14,2012/07/16,"","","read","I first heard of Browne in Borges - as so often - in the ending of ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" where the narrator is attempting to translate it into Spanish. Borges is always interested in translation (see for example his fantastic essay on translating the <i>1001 Nights</i>) and I made a note to look up this work which presented such challenges for rendering into Spanish. (The actual edition I used was James Eason's <a href=""http://penelope.uchicago.edu/hydrionoframes/hydrion.html"">online edition</a>.)<br/><br/><i>Urn Burial</i> is hugely archaic, but also amazing. I am not sure where I have last seen any literary pyrotechnics to match Browne in English. David Foster Wallace sometimes approaches him, but beyond that I draw blanks. The book defies any simple summary as many passages are cryptic tangles and Browne says many things. So I will not try, and simply present some passages that struck me:<br/><br/><blockquote>""He that lay in a golden Urne eminently above the Earth, was not likely to finde the quiet of these bones. Many of these Urnes were broke by a vulgar discoverer in hope of inclosed treasure. The ashes of <i>Marcellus</i> were lost above ground, upon the like account. Where profit hath prompted, no age hath wanted such miners. For which the most barbarous Expilators found the most civill Rhetorick. Gold once out of the earth is no more due unto it; What was unreasonably committed to the ground is reasonably resumed from it: Let Monuments and rich Fabricks, not Riches adorn mens ashes. The commerce of the living is not to be transferred unto the dead: It is not injustice to take that which none complains to lose, and no man is wronged where no man is possessor.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""If the nearnesse of our last necessity, brought a nearer conformity unto it, there were a happinesse in hoary hairs, and no calamity in half senses. But the long habit of living indisposeth us for dying; When Avarice makes us the sport of death; When even David grew politickly cruell; and Solomon could hardly be said to be the wisest of men. But many are too early old, and before the date of age. Adversity stretcheth our dayes, misery makes Alcmenas nights, and time hath no wings unto it. But the most tedious being is that which can unwish it self, content to be nothing, or never to have been, which was beyond the male-content of Job, who cursed not the day of his life, but his Nativity; Content to have so farre been, as to have a title to future being; Although he had lived here but in an hidden state of life, and as it were an abortion.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""Nature hath furnished one part of the Earth, and man another. The treasures of time lie high, in Urnes, Coynes, and Monuments, scarce below the roots of some vegetables. Time hath endlesse rarities, and shows of all varieties; which reveals old things in heaven, makes new discoveries in earth, and even earth it self a discovery. That great Antiquity <i>America</i> lay buried for a thousand years; and a large part of the earth is still in the Urne unto us.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""Some bones make best Skeletons, some bodies quick and speediest ashes: Who would expect a quick flame from Hydropicall <i>Heraclitus</i>? The poysoned Souldier when his Belly brake, put out two pyres in <i>Plutarch</i>. But in the plague of <i>Athens</i>, one private pyre served two or three Intruders; and the <i>Saracens</i> burnt in large heaps, by the King of <i>Castile</i>, shewed how little Fuell sufficeth. Though the Funerall pyre of <i>Patroclus</i> took up an hundred foot, a peece of an old boat burnt <i>Pompey</i>; And if the burthen of <i>Isaac</i> were sufficient for an holocaust, a man may carry his owne pyre.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""The long habit of living indisposeth us for dying.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""To be content that times to come should only know there was such a man, not caring whether they knew more of him, was a frigid ambition in Cardan: disparaging his horoscopal inclination and judgement of himself, who cares to subsist like Hippocrates Patients, or Achilles horses in Homer, under naked nominations, without deserts and noble acts, which are the balsame of our memories, the Entelecchia and soul of our subsistences. To be namelesse in worthy deeds exceeds an infamous history. The Canaanitish woman lives more happily without a name, then Herodias with one. And who had not rather have been the good theef, then Pilate?<br/>But the iniquity of oblivion blindely scattereth her poppy, and deals with the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity. Who can but pity the founder of the Pyramids? Herostratus lives that burnt the Temple of Diana, he is almost lost that built it; Time hath spared the Epitaph of Adrians horse, confounded that of himself. In vain we compute our felicities by the advantage of our good names, since bad have equall durations; and Thersites is like to live as long as Agamenon, [without the favour of the everlasting Register:] Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot, then any that stand remembred in the known account of time? without the favour of the everlasting Register the first man had been as unknown as the last, and Methuselahs long life had been his only Chronicle.""</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""What Song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzling Questions are not beyond all conjecture. What time the persons of these Ossuaries entred the famous Nations of the dead, and slept with Princes and Counsellours, might admit a wide resolution. But who were the proprietaries of these bones, or what bodies these ashes made up, were a question above Antiquarism. Not to be resolved by man, nor easily perhaps by spirits, except we consult the Provinciall Guardians, or tutellary Observators. Had they made as good provision for their names, as they have done for their Reliques, they had not so grosly erred in the art of perpetuation. But to subsist in bones, and be but Pyramidally extant, is a fallacy in duration. Vain ashes, which in the oblivion of names, persons, times, and sexes, have found unto themselves, a fruitlesse continuation, and only arise unto late posterity, as Emblemes of mortall vanities; Antidotes against pride, vain-glory, and madding vices. Pagan vain-glories which thought the world might last for ever, had encouragement for ambition, and finding no Atropos unto the immortality of their Names, were never dampt with the necessity of oblivion. Even old ambitions had the advantage of ours, in the attempts of their vain-glories, who acting early, and before the probable Meridian of time, have by this time found great accomplishment of their designes, whereby the ancient Heroes have already out-lasted their Monuments, and Mechanicall preservations. But in this latter Scene of time we cannot expect such Mummies unto our memories, when ambition may fear the Prophecy of Elias, and Charles the fifth can never hope to live within two Methusela's of Hector.""</blockquote>","","","","","",0,,,,,

It was surprisingly unliterary and unpostmodern for Mitchell, but in exchange, he nailed the historical details and gave us an adventure which subverted many of the usual tropes - the raid on the nunnery was just a trap, the hero doesn't get the girl, his chief heroism was standing there to be shot at, and the man who takes down the big baddie is someone we thought to be entirely in the baddie's pocket. The supernatural aspects are implied to be genuine, but it's never resolved, which I am grateful for. It would ruin the feel.","","","","","",0,,,,,

The prose is so smooth that like Gene Wolfe's, it becomes invisible, and you pass through it to the slow silent sorrow of the protagonist. Ishiguro makes the tragedy clear enough, shows us the heart of the story, but without ever being gauche.<br/><br/>In July 2012, I re-read it and for good measure, I watched the movie too. (The movie, IMO, was pretty good with excellent casting, if unfortunately often blunter than the novel and the ending especially so.)<br/><br/>What struck me this time through was the ending of the novel: the butler has come to realize that his life has been suboptimal and less joyful than it could have been because he shunned Miss Kenton and denied his emotions out of a misguided sense of professionalism. But instead of the typical Hollywood ending where he woos Miss Kenton or quits his job etc, he realizes that it really is too late: his and Miss Kenton's day is almost over, and the important thing to do is make the most of 'the remains of the day', which for him is returning to his butlering job but being less rigid and more human.<br/><br/>It is, in other words, a beautiful tale of not honoring sunk costs or pursuing lost opportunities.","","http://lesswrong.com/lw/ddt/july_2012_media_thread/72qw","3","","",0,,,,,

Did it yield any caliphates, say? Anarchistic self-governing communes? Self-governing city-states? Hanseatic Leagues? Or look at official rhetoric in places like China. Look at the gradual and continuing expansion of capitalism and democracy as the defaults for every country.

He is the closest thing to a modern Jorge Luis Borges in melding high concepts with literature to create something better than either; in some respects, I'd rank his best short stories as better than Gene Wolfe's. His writing is deceptively excellent: I would call him a writer's writer, because the flat evenness of his prose may strike a reader as boring unless they have tried to write as clearly themselves and failed abysmally, at which point they begin to appreciate Chiang's infallible choice of words and lucid prose which sinks into the mind without friction.<br/><br/><i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> is much superior to his novella <i>Life Cycle of Software Objects</i>, and contains pretty much all of his greatest short stories which I have read, except for his excellent <a href=""http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html"">""Exhalation""</a>. I read most of them online, so when I had the chance to read a hardcopy of the full collection, I seized it.<br/><br/>1. ""The Tower of Babylon""; amusing, and in describing the lives of the people living on the tower, moving in some respects. The final ending feels like an appropriate conclusion. If one had to criticize it, it would be that the Tower itself is completely unrealistic even in the Biblical cosmology of the story: as I said, the best Chiang stories unite literature and good ideas. I would rank this #5 of the 8 stories.<br/>2. <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130112204225/http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/division/full/"">""Division by Zero""</a>; not terribly impressive - over-wrought, and I feel I have read this story before and better. #7.<br/>3. <a href=""http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm"">""Understand""</a>; a classic in the niche genre of superintelligence, and IMO better than Vinge's ""Bookworm, Run!"" and at least as good as <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>. Chiang, like every other author, confronts the limits of his writing ability in trying to write convincingly of a superintelligence who is by definition vastly smarter than he is (the same challenge laid down by Campbell to Vinge: ""you can't write this story, and neither can anyone else""), and so the start of the story is much stronger than the later passages. But the whole is still memorable. #4.<br/>4. <a href=""http://www.ime.usp.br/~jstern/miscellanea/General/Chiang98.pdf"">""Story of Your Life""</a>; I had actually read this one before, and dismissed it as sentimental tripe with some weak physics or linguistic layering that I didn't really understand. Fortunately, just a few weeks ago I happened to read some material on the Lagrangian interpretations of physics and combined with knowing in advance the ending, I was able to appreciate the story much better this time. I would rank this #3 of the 8 stories. #3.<br/>5. <a href=""http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/evolution.html"">""The Evolution of Human Science""</a>; short, dubious. Not Chiang's best work, on either dimension. #8.<br/>6. <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20010802144026/http://www.tor.com/72ltrs.html"">""Seventy-Two Letters""</a>; simply fantastic. The setting is wonderful, the problem great, the ideas even better, and the solution & meaning better still. #2.<br/>7. <a href=""http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html"">""Hell Is the Absence of God""</a>; as an atheist who keeps coming back to the Book of Job, this story came as a gut punch. The writing is Chiang at his most Chiang-y, the world interesting and provocative, and the ending simply unspeakable. But don't take my word for it, 'decide for yourself', as the fallen angels say. #1.<br/>8. <a href=""http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/liking.html"">""Liking What You See: A Documentary""</a>; interesting ideas, but something about the dialogues and characters seem off. It just jars me. #6.","","","","","",0,,,,,

But having finished reading it, I'm disappointed. It's not fit to shine Jaynes's boot buckle; while Jaynes's theory has serious problems (explaining where bicameralism went, worldwide, and other chronological problems, for starters), it at least was an elegant theory that fit a great many facts!<br/><br/>Wright and his co-author, on the other hand, is chock-full of anecdotes (better ping-pong playing and relaxation playing with your left hand? really?); data seems misrepresented (I did not recognize his description of the peg data in the sleep deprivation experiment with the actual graph); dismissal of possibilities as 'implausible' which are perfectly plausible (the claim that testosterone can't damage one hemisphere and help the other comes to mind, as does the claim that there are no plausible evolutionary theories for evolving handedness - actually, there's a very elegant competition explanation which anyone who has done a head-to-head sport like ping-pong or fencing could appreciate); fully general counter-arguments like the claim that not appreciating the theory is evidence of being damaged as the theory predicts; excuse-making for the absence of forest fossils supporting their theory; blatantly false claims about bipedalism mixed in with distraction about the aquatic ape theory; claims about agricultural longevity which are surely the elementary mistake of assuming that infant mortality-dominated average lifespans say much about how adults actually lived; invocation of pseudoscience like photoreading or Carlos Castaneda or 140-year olds in distant Third World countries (seriously? seriously‽) or Alzheimer's and other diseases being caused by dehydration; blatant confirmation bias† (who, interested in people who do not sleep, would mention a Vietnamese woman and <i>not</i> mention fatal familial insomnia?); and of course, vitamin C megadoses must appear in any work by fruitarians, as does the claim that cooking reduces the nutritional value of food (which would come as news to anthropologists, who regard the introduction of fire as possibly the key breakthrough to enabling large expensive brains - except that right, the authors believe that <i>fruit</i> is what enabled large brains, well, I wonder why they might not discuss the caloric value of cooking food... perhaps it's because cooked food doesn't 'raise micro-electric potentials throughout the body').<br/><br/>† which becomes ever more important in data-rich noisy fields like psychology; I actually pointed this out for dual n-back recently on <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4204653"">Hacker News</a> and more generally in my <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#flaws-in-mainstream-science-and-psychology"">DNB FAQ</a><br/><br/>The use of autists, idiot savants, and TMS is an interesting topic in its own right, but inadvertently sabotages the thesis. There's a legal saying, 'hard cases make bad law'; in neuroscience, damaged patients make bad theories. The brain is Turing-complete and can exhibit arbitrarily complex problems: these patients tend to be fairly unique, and how are you going to build any kind of theory on them? To the extent we can infer anything, it's that there is a common trait among those with access to low-level processing: they are <i>not smart</i>. Their abilities seem to come at the expense of all other abilities or higher-level processing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek"">Kim Peek</a> may have memorized thousands of books, but what sort of understanding did this man with an IQ of 89 exhibit of them? Very little. The child prodigy artist may be able to render remarkably detailed artwork, but a camera is more accurate and just as artistic as I've ever heard him be. This does not bode well for any exaltation of the right hemisphere...<br/><br/>The crowning piece of nonsense is probably the 'loop' between fruits, steroids, and DNA. This idea, lovingly illustrated in multiple graphs, is fractal nonsense: the more you look at each piece, the worse it gets. It's as if someone told you that car evolution was steered by gas stations: you see, a human drives the car to a gas station, the car is filled up with gas, the gas changes the car, changing how it drives to the next gas station and how it reacts to the next fill-up. This may initially seem plausible until you look at step 3, which reads basically like the old _Far Side_ strip - <a href=""http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/Miracle.html"">'And then a miracle occurs'</a>. How <i>exactly</i> do steroids rewrite the DNA? A steroid is not a little computer or nanobot which can go into a sperm or egg - and notice the quiet eliding of the difference between somatic and germ-line cells, it's perfectly possible for any genetic or epigenetic changes to not be passed on - and rewrite the DNA as it wishes. If variations in circulating levels of some chemical affect DNA, it must do so via receptors and proteins set up in advance by gradual evolution to do specific things - eg. think of how alligators or crocodiles vary the sex ratio of their offspring in response to ambient temperatures, this is set up in advance because it's useful, the temperature doesn't 'just cause' the sex ratio to vary in some magical way because boy alligators are fiery and analogous to hot weather while female crocodiles are chillier and aloof. (I'm reminded of the genie of the lamp: ""I wish everyone was happy!"" Well, OK, but what does that <i>actually</i> mean and how should the genie do it?) They are, naturally, as sure of this evolutionary loop as one can be in the complete absence of all evidence.<br/><br/>While we're on DNA, I was deeply amused that they could propose this system as their primary explanation, and then throughout the rest of the book dismiss any further adaptation because a few hundred thousand years was not enough! I really think that we can adapt to eating meat in a few hundred thousand years, especially when our primate ancestors and surviving lineages often do eat meat... It was especially funny to read ""It is highly unlikely that the DNA selection process could have achieved this rapid result (certainly not on the savanna where hominids would be subjected to hard and stressful environmental conditions)""; hard and stressful conditions are exactly the kind of selection pressure that might drive large increases in any organ or body part, and allometric scaling in general is one of the easier things for evolution to change if it's fitness-increasing. (Changing size is a lot easier than developing an organ from scratch, that's for sure. Size is a tweak.)<br/><br/>These are only my notes for the first 80 pages. After that, I gave up and read on in a sort of stunned state. At least it does deign to include some sort of references (although it doesn't link specific claims to specific papers, seems kind of skimpy, and is very heavy on books - which aren't very useful in the sense that now you have an entire book to read just to check a few claims).<br/><br/>It helps that I've read up on many of the same topics for entirely different reasons, so I have a good idea of the general framework of various fields and where they're making huge extrapolations or passing over contrary evidence. 'What is good in it is not original, and what is original is not good.'<br/><br/>The disturbing thing for me is that so many of the references and facts are familiar, and it's written fairly well. I'm reminded of Anatole France:<br/><br/><blockquote>What frightens us most in a madman is his sane conversation.</blockquote>","","","","","",0,,,,,

On the one hand, Dyson digs up all sorts of quotable lines and anecdotes and biographical details, many genuinely new to me. I enjoyed those greatly. For these I give it 4 stars. On the other hand...<br/><br/>He is obsessed with Von Neumann's IAS/MANIAC, to the detriment of the rest of the book. The pre-WWII history is OK but signally fails to explain things like the Hilbert program, Goedel or Turing's actual halting theorem.  Someone who read this expecting to understand 'Turing's cathedral' would be vastly better served reading a book like Hofstadter's _Goedel, Escher, Bach_ (as old as it is). Instead, countless pages are taken up with detailed technical information that is simultaneously in depth and also poorly explained. I repeatedly got the feeling that Dyson is indulging in that common temptation, allocating material based on how much effort it took to find, not what would inform the reader - he went through a lot of work documenting MANIAC and the rest of us must enjoy (suffer) the fruits of it. I felt that if I didn't already know a great deal of this material, I would be completely lost inside the book; I wonder how much other people could get out of it.<br/><br/>The repeated analogies to search engines and modern computing come off very poorly (search engines are analogue? Oookkaayyy....); much could have been said about how modern chip architectures and cloud computing designs are not very Von Neumannian now, so here again I wonder if it's a forced attempt to show contemporary relevance or perhaps just influence from his Google visit.<br/><br/>Other parts make one question how much Dyson understands: he links Goedelian/Turing incompleteness to computer viruses and concludes with grand '90s-esque visions (pace Kevin Kelly's old _Out of Control_ book) of viruses spreading out through the Internet and beating on the walls of clean computers - but viruses aren't really a problem these days, nothing like they used to be, and the situation seems apt to only improve! Like spam, the solutions are not perfect and require a great deal of manpower & cleverness, but they are working and currently seem likely to steadily improve; this wouldn't be a surprise to him if he had really appreciated that Goedelian/Turing-incompleteness implies that there *are* large decidable subsets of programs and we can build our systems out of those. (Every programmer who uses a language with a decent type system is doing something a naive understanding of incompleteness says is impossible: he's executing nontrivial predicates over his program.)<br/><br/>For those reasons and others, this will never get 5 stars from me, and if there were a 3.5 stars, I'd go with that.","","","","","",0,,,,,

It has come to this. WoT finally ended.<br/><br/>I remember how the wheel of dharma began to turn for me: my mother ran a Girl Scouts troop while I was in middle school, and sometimes they met at a local town rec center. Rather than try to participate, I would sometimes kill time in the lounge reading their old donated paperbacks. One of them was remarkably thick, but the cover looked interesting, and I was hooked by the opening passages: a Tolkien-esque chapter about a young lad heading back to the Shire and haunted by a Ring-wraith. (Not so much the Prologue, which was too mystifying.) I'd read Tolkien by this point, of course, and wondered if it'd be an awful shameful ripoff like _Sword of Shannara_, but I kept reading.<br/><br/>The opening was nifty enough but not gripping, at least until I reached Moiraine's speech to the villagers about Manetheren. I was spellbound and had not been so gripped at least since Tolkien with Gimli's dirge for the dwarves in the Mines of Moria. And the book didn't stop there: there was the creepy interlude at the cursed city of Shadar Logoth, the even more creepy Machin Shin of the Waygates, the unusual Templar/Children of the Light, the intriguing uncertainty about which of the kids was the Main Character (you <i>thought</i> it was Rand, of course, as the major viewpoint, but the dreams kept you uncertain - surely the author wouldn't throw those in if there weren't a good chance the obvious choice wouldn't be picked?), the good troll character who is a scholar rather than a warrior, a Western-samurai militaristic setting a whole city of female magicians, Old Tongue on every other page culminating in no less than the Green Man at the Eye of the World (just one of many nods to real-world things). I was impressed as I read it over the weeks, meeting by meeting, and soon checked out the other 6 or so. This was a long time ago. A very long time ago.<br/><br/>Indeed, WoT could be considered Tolkien turned up. Tolkien had a cast of hundreds? WoT would have a cast of thousands! Tolkien had a few countries going to war against a dark lord? WoT would have dozens of countries and regions! Tolkien had two or three scheming magicians? WoT would have scores of scheming magicians, and they would be split into more than a dozen groups, all scheming. Tolkien had one or two trolls? WoT would have trolls too, all over the place, and they'd be the good kind, peaceful scholar; and Tolkien had a character recording events for a history, well, that's a perfect task for one of the scholar-trolls. Tolkien had a few Ring-wraiths and a big fight against one at the end, well, WoT would have ring-wraiths in every book and they'd be a standard foe (which makes sense given all the magical powers given to every other character: you need to power up the bad guys if you power up the good guys). The Shire would be tainted by evil due to the hero & companions coming from there and eventually have to be led to an uprising? Emond's Field would never fall and would wage epic battle against Padan Fain et al. And so on.<br/><br/>You couldn't say that Wheel of Time had the restrained scholarly English sensibility of LotR, but it packed a punch. If LotR was the novel, WoT was the video game or maybe movie adaptation, with everything dialed up to 11 and an unlimited budget for explosions & exotic locations. And it did this very well in the early books. In that sense, it's an excellent 'Tolkien for teenagers'. (In another sense, reusing the old 'hidden prince' trope of being born to a destiny and with arcane powers, WoT is also good for teens: they've long loved that trope, perhaps because at that age they desperately love the idea of being given a defined role and the (unearned) ability to fill it. This trope is perhaps a bit too narcissistic for adults to enjoy as much, although given how popular <i>Frozen</i> has been and how many people, child or adult, claim to identify with Elsa, I may be wrong here.)<br/><br/>One of the lessons I learned from WoT was learning the hard way why one should avoid in-progress series: the mental suffering and time expended is radically out of proportion to the pleasure. (I am handily applying this lesson now to that *other* endless vast fantasy epic, GRRM. Given my pre-2007 comments that it was entirely possible that Jordan would die before finishing, I wonder how that one will turn out.) Another lesson is that length and a big cast of characters should not be taken as a goal in its own right because you descend into repetition and cliche.<br/><br/>In some sense, Sanderson's AMoL for me succeeds just by existing and giving me closure. I would be happy if it is not as enraging as King's ending to _The Dark Tower_, or as unremittingly awful and a disgrace to all parties involved as Brian Herbert & KJA's work in the Dune universe. Perhaps all the people on Goodreads who are leaving laudatory 5 star reviews without even reading the book and apparently are ignorant of what a ""review"" is feel the same way - that as long as it's not awful, it deserves 5 stars for giving them closure.<br/><br/>And it's neither enraging nor terribly awful, so I am satisfied.<br/><br/>I share a lot of the complaints I've seen in other reviews. Some characters like Moiraine do nothing interesting; others have compressed endings like Luc/Isam and Padan Fain. Bela dies despite an expectation that she would continue her improbable luck. The body-swapping is unprecedented and confusing, since it apparently is not due to Rand indulging in cosmic powers but a mysterious gray-haired woman who I could not understand after two reads and googling a bit. The resolution of confrontation with the Dark One was clever as far as it went, but it relied on a feature of Callandor I am pretty sure was not mentioned before and I feel a bit deus ex machina-d, although I'm relieved that the general interpretation of Herid Fel's basic point that because of the Wheel, you have to restore the prison to how it was *before* the Bore (rather than patch it again, kill the Dark One, etc) was correct.<br/><br/>There were many great bits. Rand and Matt bragging in one of their last meetings. Lan taking down Damodred (although didn't we see the suicidal maneuver in a previous book...). Min vs spies. Demandred and Graendal make the Forsaken look less incompetent than usual. Thom casually knifing women while composing a poem.<br/><br/>Many bad parts.<br/><br/>The endless grinding battle - by the time I finished the book, I felt as exhausted as if I'd been pushing pikes with Trollocs myself. The worst part was, despite the endless pages of battle, the battles still didn't feel epic or hardfought; they lacked any urgency or real drama. Perhaps WoT just massively over-indulged in battles before, or perhaps the battles were just disconnected - it's a bad thing when you have characters lampshading the triviality of what they're doing and asking 'so why does this matter when the only battle that matters is Rand vs DO?' The battles are weirdly parochial and limited to a few locations. 4 battlefronts is impressive? For the Last Battle, a worldwide struggle against the Shadow? We didn't get so much as one point of view in, I dunno, Seanchan which was supposed to have waged its own epic struggle against Shadowspawn during the original colonization! We don't get Waygates popping open in hundreds of locations, the entire Randland convulsed in thousands of battles... Basically, we didn't see a world at war. We bounced between 4 locations again and again and again until it was an incredible chore to read another page. Last minute rescues are a storytelling device that work only a few times. In a chapter. Before they lose any impact.<br/><br/>Some of the writing seems stiff and clumsy, and I liked Matt less than in the previous book so I suppose that was just an anomaly.<br/><br/>The 'philosophy' bits of the Rand vs DO encounter were seriously juvenile; so Rand overcomes the DO with the Power of Love but then he realizes that to destroy the DO, he would take away Free Will! And just as any idiot could have predicted, he has to leave the DO alone and repair the prison good as new. And of course the DO whines at him and Rand has to lecture him self-righteously... Give me a break. I'm sure that this must have been Jordon's notes, because I remember Sanderson doing better in _Mistborn_.<br/><br/>I suspect people will be identifying loose ends and missed prophecies or Min-visions for years to come. At least we did sorta find out who killed Asmodean.<br/><br/>So now that it is finished, what should I think of WoT? Would I recommend it to a younger version of me? I think I would. In bulk, WoT's flaws are reduced. The repetition fades away like the Homeric epithets filling out lines, and the multi-million word count becomes less intimidating. The awful middle-late books, like possibly the series nadir _Winter's Heart_, lose their severe aggravation when you have all the books in a pile waiting to be read instead of an unknown multi-year wait upon an author who may (and did) die on you. Without years between reads, the plots and characters will be easier to track, and even if one fails to pick up on clues or asides, the resolution will be delivered soon and one can go 'ah!' as one newly appreciates a new thread of the pattern.<br/><br/>But I would accompany it with this caution: <br/><br/>""WoT, in small chunks, is not good. The characters and writing is repetitious, the descriptions pedestrian; few passages will move you with the beauty of strangeness or exoticism that marks the best fantasy. What WoT does is take the 'quantity vs quality' tradeoff, and jam it all the way to 'quantity', to see what happens, and does so more extremely than any other fantasy series I know of. If you want to see 'epic fantasy', with a cast of who knows how many thousands, spread over more countries than you can keep straight, and watch this tapestry evolve over years and millions of words, then you must read WoT. If you want to maximize your enjoyment per word, if you want the heights of what the fantasy genre can deliver in terms of quality, then put away WoT for another day and instead do something like read through chronologically the winners of the Locus & World Fantasy Awards.""<br/><br/>There have been worse obituaries for pieces of your childhood.","true","","","","",0,,,,,

Norton & Company","Hardcover","454",2007,2007,2013/10/24,2012/07/16,"","","read","<i>Discovery of France</i> charts the transition of the region covered by modern France into the unified cultural/political/geographic entity of today. This is incredibly interesting because from our perspective, we have forgotten (if we ever knew) what went into the process of taking the thousands of villages and regions differing in all sorts of ways, and crushing them into the relatively homogeneous high-tech culture of today - unifying languages, political systems, forms of transportation, religion, and so on. A theme throughout is Scott's legibility (<i>Seeing Like A State</i>); Robb gives all sorts of examples demonstrating local knowledge, specialized information, and resistance to outsiders.<br/><br/>Often people dramatically underestimate this. It's easy to assume that the vast nation-states like China or America just sort of came into existence naturally, but this overlooks the amount of effort Chinese/American governments/organizations have put into unification, in aspects ranging from stamping out as many languages and other cultures as possible to simplifying existing languages (particularly striking in China) to enforcing standardized units & measures (encouraging cash crops is a good way) to standardized national educational curriculum inculcating patriotism and common beliefs. You may not think that they are 'unified', but they are far more unified than they used to be - contrast the original 13 American colonies to how large America is now, or look at historical maps of Han China with the current boundaries, and think about all the cultural, linguistic, political, and economic differences that used to exist, and how many of, say, the languages are now extinct. (To say nothing of the peoples... Tibet and the American Indians come to mind as examples unique only for the documentation and notice taken of their particular instance.) The process of homogenization and simplification happens in many large countries, for easily-understood reasons such as the convenience of the state. Besides Robb & Scott, some views of this process can be found in Fukuyama's <i>The Origins of Political Order</i> for China. (You could also get a bit of the American process out of Howard Zinn's <i>A People's History of the United States</i> by looking at various incidents in the right way, but that's too polemical & focused on other topics for me to really recommend.)<br/><br/>This may sound like a very grand theme, but Robb is able to give so many fascinating examples that one forgets the underlying demonstration and just basks in the knowledge of how the past is a very foreign country. (As I mention in my review of <i>The Dark Enlightenment</i>, a sense of distance and alienation is one of the things I prize most in historical works - while there is continuity, continuity is easy to find and it is beyond easy to portray the past as proceeding Whiggishly and comprehensibly into the present, obscuring all the ways in which we are profoundly alien from the past.)<br/><br/>Where do I start... The extraordinary fact that until the 20th century, French was only a plurality language in France? The stiltwalking shepherds? The horrifying bits about drunken dying babies being carted to Paris by the 'angel-makers'? The packs of smuggler dogs who smuggled goods in and out of France for their human masters? (Or the dog-powered factories?) The forgotten persecution of the cagot caste? The Parisian who sold maggots to fisherman, which he raised in his closet on a pile of cat & dog roadkill collected from the streets? The wars between rival villages? The commuting peasants who thought nothing of a 50 mile walk? The strange twists of fate that lead regions to specialize in particular wares? The villages of cretins or families who regard a cretinous child as a gift from god? The mapping of the hidden communication networks that spread rumor at the speed of a horse? The corvée system of road-building, so inefficient at points that transporting the materials to build 1 more meter of a road could destroy more than 1 meter of that same road?

Time and again, I was shocked to find subjects treated of keen interest to me, or which read like Pinker had taken some of my essays but done them way better (on terrorism, on the expanding circle, etc.); even so, I was surprised to learn new things (resource problems don't correlate well with violence?).<br/><br/>I initially thought I might excerpt some parts of it for an essay or article, but as the quotes kept piling up, I realized that it was hopeless. Reading reviews or discussions of it is not enough; Pinker just covers too much and rebuts too many possible criticisms. It's very long, as a result, but absorbing.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Sadly, I find myself even less interested than _The Sorcerer's House_ in figuring out the secret - but I am more interested, and I enjoyed _Pirate Freedom_ more, than _An Evil Guest_. Faint praise, perhaps. Reading through the old email threads to see what I missed, I'm not sure about some of the ideas floating around.<br/><br/>First, where's this stuff about him being cloned coming from? The one bit of evidence I've seen is a quote to the effect that ""my father made me""; I can't find this in my _Pirate Freedom_ EPUB (but FBReader seems to have buggy search so this may not count). But at face value, this seems completely unconvincing to me: he's a *Mafia* guy! All ""my father made me"" means is that he's a ""made man"", as one would expect of the son of a big Mafia figure. Chris even says at one point to a new pirate something to the effect 'now you're a made man'. Presumably no one thinks Chris just zapped him with some tailored RNA viruses... ""Half-human monster"" is more promising, but in context, there's no mention of simply human: ""The artists of the Middle Ages painted allegories, we say. What really happened was that they saw more clearly than we do, and painted what they saw - angels and devils, beasts, and half-human monsters like me."" The artists were painting clones? Or is this just more Christian thought a la Pope? The best line is ""I am taller than most people - my father told me once he got me engineered that way - and I was taller than he was by quite a bit."" but height has been known to be heritable since Galton and a fair number of genes & SNPs have already been identified responsible for variance (eg. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n7/abs/ng.608.html"">~50% from SNPs</a>), so even simple embryo selection (make multiple embryos, sequence the genomes of each, implant the best-scoring one) would work for that. <br/><br/>Second, there's something really weird about the lack of attention paid to the timeslips. Chris doesn't even explicitly mention anything about time travel until like pg 80 where he says it just sank in (?!!?!), and the implication is that the timeslip happened long before he left for the entire monastery: the enrolled kids are, after the closure of the school is announced, implied to be different from the previous kids, and at some point Chris notices no one has wristwatches. Now, this is the same Chris who after wandering around colonial age Cuba and sailing ships still hasn't noticed what time period he is in, so the safe assumption is that the wristwatches disappeared when the school closed. So the entire monastery has been timeslipped for many years, and we are told that some of the monks go out to hear confessions each week, so the timeslip could not have gone unnoticed for more than a week at worst. So what's going on here with the monastery? The lack of contact is curious, as Chris points out and as is emphasized when we learn that Chris thinks his house is so close that he'll just walk there - he didn't sneak out at any point, or have a vacation or break? (His father can't visit him, but nothing is said of Chris visiting his father.)<br/><br/>His obliviousness and rationalizations are supposedly not that: he claims to pump for information the farmer he meets with the horse, but  why didn't he just turn around and go back to the monastery and ask 'hey guys - what *happened*?' He also then rationalizes blatantly: ""And it was not there. I decided then that there were two Havanas, or maybe the city had changed its name and this little town had taken it over."" Sure, Chris. Sure. That's totally plausible.<br/><br/>Having read a bunch of theories on the ML, I can't say any of them seem especially plausible. No one has a good explanation of Jaime's self-immolation or disappearance, Valentin & dog's murder, the apparent foreknowledge of Lesage, Chris's father (if he is a later Chris, why is he much shorter than his 'son'?) or the monastery's behavior. Nothing that ties them all together. It's a little frustrating, since once the various points are identified it feels like there should be an obvious answer.<br/><br/>I feel a little like after reading _The Sorcerer's House_or _An Evil Guest_ here: by the end we've identified what the solution ought to look like (another time traveler acting at various points in the story / Bax killing his twin and usurping his identity / Cassie going to Woldercon and maybe time-traveling herself), but we don't know how to go beyond that and make the whole thing fall into a satisfying whole (who and how and why / how the letters were mistakenly or deliberately rearranged and the deceptions before the final deception-letter / what Cassie actually did).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>On a side note, the speech about the many Church sex abuse scandals is disgusting. I don't take this as Wolfe deliberately giving us evidence of Chris being a depraved monster, it reads too sincerely and is consistent with the increasingly conservative crankery I've documented elsewhere (although I fully expect someone to reply saying 'no, don't confuse the text with the author, let's interpret it as charitably as possible', just like they did with the <a href=""http://lists.urth.net/pipermail/urth-urth.net/2012-July/027396.html""><i>non</i>fiction predictions by Wolfe</a> I posted); the lead-up to his speech is itself misleading and slanted, completely ignoring the central enabling coverup role the Church played for decades upon end. There is no reason to not mention the Church's role, since the Bishop is not otherwise portrayed sympathetically and mentioning it would both be factually accurate and continue characterizing the Bishop... The setup is also, shall we say, curious for making the victims adolescents and not younger still as they so often were. It's also a little strange that Wolfe expects the 'Communists to fall'. Even when this was being written, Cuba's government had been substantially liberalizing and privatizing. There's pretty much no reason to expect them to 'fall' as opposed to follow a gradual transition to being, like China, Communist in name-only.","","","","","",0,,,,,

Delany seems to be of the opinion that great literature is meaningless and shocking (and long), and so the more deviant sex and violence the better. Looking at the positive reviews, I am reminded of a sarcastic comment by Karl Popper: ""'I did not understand a word; but <i>I know: this is philosophy</i>' was the deep conviction of a highly gifted young physicist after he had heard Martin Heidegger speak."" Similarly for <i>Dhalgren</i>: the emperor has no clothes, but that's a very gay thing to do and so he is feted and admired as shocking and edgy - if people don't like it, it must be good!<br/><br/>The most I can say for it is that it seems to evoke well middle-class New Yorkers' fears about the increasing crime rate portending a descent into violent anarchy & the 'concrete jungle'.","","","","","",0,,,,,
