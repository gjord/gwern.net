# Problems with "conversion" metric

https://support.google.com/websiteoptimizer/bin/answer.py?hl=en-AU&answer=74345 "Time on page as a conversion goal" - every page converts, by using a timeout (mine is 40 seconds). Problem: dichotomizing a continuous variable into a single binary variable destroys a massive amount of information. This is well-known in the statistical and psychological literature (eg. [MacCallum et al 2002](http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/measures/content/maccallum_on_dichotomizing.pdf "On the Practice of Dichotomization of Quantitative Variables")) but I'll illustrate further with some information-theoretical observations.

According to my Analytics, the mean reading time (time on page) is 1:47 and the maximum bracket, hit by 1% of viewers, is 1801 seconds, and the range 1-1801 takes <10.8 bits to encode (`log2(1801) ~> 10.81`), hence each page view could be represented by <10.8 bits (less since reading time is so highly skewed). But if we dichotomize, then we learn simply that ~14% of readers will read for 40 seconds, hence each reader carries not 6 bits, nor 1 bit (if 50% read that long) but closer to 2/3 of a bit:

~~~{.R}
R> p=0.14;  q=1-p; (-p*log2(p) - q*log2(q))
[1] 0.5842
~~~

This isn't even an efficient dichotomization: we could improve the fractional bit to 1 bit if we could somehow dichotomize at 50% of readers:

~~~{.R}
R> p=0.50;  q=1-p; (-p*log2(p) - q*log2(q))
[1] 1
~~~

But unfortunately, simply lowering the timeout will have minimal returns as Analytics also reports that 82% of reader spend 0-10 seconds on pages. So we are stuck with a severe loss.

# Testing
## `max-width`

CSS-3 property: set how wide the page will be in pixels if unlimited screen real estate is available. I noticed some people complained that pages were 'too wide' and this made it hard to read, which apparently is a real thing since lines are supposed to fit in eye saccades. So I tossed in 800px, 900px, 1300px, and 1400px to the first A/B test.

~~~

It ran from mid-June to 1 August 2012. Unfortunately, I cannot be more specific: on 1 August, Google deleted Website Optimizer and told everyone to use 'Experiments' in Google Analytics - and *deleted all my information*. The graph over time, the exact numbers - all gone. So this is from memory.

The results were initially very promising: 'conversion' was defined as staying on a page for 40 seconds (I reasoned that this meant someone was actually reading the page), and had a base of around 70% of readers converting. With a few hundred hits, 900px converted at 10-20% more than the default! I was ecstatic. So when it began falling, I was only a little bothered (one had to expect some regression to the mean since the results were too good to be true). But as the hits increased into the low thousands, the effect kept shrinking all the way down to 0.4% improved conversion. At some points, 1300px actually exceeded 900px.

The second distressing thing was that Google's estimated chance of a particular intervention beating the default (which I believe is a Bonferroni-corrected _p_-value), did not increase! Even as each version received 20,000 hits, the chance stubbornly bounced around the 70-90% range for 900px and 1300px. This remained true all the way to the bitter end. At the end, each version had racked up 93,000 hits *and still was in the 80% decile*. Wow.

Ironically, I was warned at the beginning about both of these possible behaviors by a paper I read on large-scale corporate A/B testing: http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/puzzlingOutcomesInControlledExperiments.pdf and http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/controlledExperimentDMKD.pdf and http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/2013%20controlledExperimentsAtScale.pdf It covered at length how many apparent trends simply evaporated, but it also covered later a peculiar phenomenon where A/B tests did not converge even after being run on ungodly amounts of data because the standard deviations kept changing (the user composition kept shifting and rendering previous data more uncertain). And it's a general phenomenon that even for large correlations, the trend will bounce around a lot before it stabilizes ([Schönbrodt & Perugini 2013](http://www.psy.lmu.de/allg2/download/schoenbrodt/pub/stable_correlations.pdf "At what sample size do correlations stabilize?")).

Oy vey! When I discovered Google had deleted my results, I decided to simply switch to 900px. Running a new test would not provide any better answers.

# Resumption: ABalytics

In March 2013, I decided to give A/B testing another whack. Google Analytics Experiment did not seem to have improved and the commercial services continued to charge unacceptable prices, so I gave the Google Analytics custom variable integration approach another trying using [ABalytics](https://github.com/danmaz74/ABalytics). The usual puzzling, debugging, and frustration of combining so many disparate technologies (HTML *and* CSS *and* JS *and* Google Analytics) aside, it seemed to work on my test page. The current downside seems to be that the ABalytics approach may be fragile, and the UI in GA is awful (you have to do the statistics yourself).

## `max-width` redux

The obvious test case is to rerun the `max-width` test, and this time get the data.

### Implementation

The exact changes:

    +      }, _gaq);
    +
~~~

### Results

I wound up the test on 17 April 2013 with the following results:

Width (px) Visits Conversion
---------- ------ ----------
1100       18,164 14.49%
1300       18,071 14.28%
1200       18,150 13.99%
800        18,599 13.94%
900        18,419 13.78%
1400       18,378 13.68%
           109772 14.03%

### Analysis

1100px is close to my original A/B test indicating 1000px was the leading candidate, so that gives me additional confidence, as does the observation that 1300px and 1200px are the other leading candidates. (Curiously, the site conversion average before was 13.88%; perhaps my underlying traffic changed slightly around the time of the test? This would demonstrate why alternatives need to be tested simultaneously.) A quick and dirty R test of 1100px vs 1300px (`prop.test(c(2632,2581),c(18164,18071))`) indicates the difference isn't statistically-significant (at _p_=0.58), and we might want more data.

But I want to move on to the next test and by the same logic it is highly unlikely that the difference between them is large or much in 1300px's favor (the kind of mistake I care about: switching between 2 equivalent choices doesn't matter, missing out on an improvement *does* matter - maximizing β, not minimizing α).

## Fonts

The _New York Times_ ran [an informal online experiment](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/ "Hear, All Ye People; Hearken, O Earth (Part One)") with a large number of readers (_n_=60750) and found that the [Baskerville](!Wikipedia) font led to more readers agreeing with a short text passage - this seems plausible enough given their very large sample size and Wikipedia's note that "The refined feeling of the typeface makes it an excellent choice to convey dignity and tradition."

### Power analysis

Would this font work its magic on `gwern.net` too? Let's see. The sample size is quite manageable, as over a month I will easily have 60k visits, and they tested 6 fonts, expanding their necessary sample. What sample size do I actually need? Their professor estimates the effect size of Baskerville at 1.5%; I would like my A/B test to have very high statistical power (0.9) and reach more stringent statistical-significance (_p_<0.01) so I can go around and in good conscience tell people to use Baskerville. I already know the average "conversion rate" is ~13%, so I get this power calculation:

~~~{.R}
power.prop.test(p1=0.13+0.015, p2=0.13, power=0.90, sig.level=0.01)

     Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation

              n = 15683
             p1 = 0.145
             p2 = 0.13
      sig.level = 0.01
          power = 0.9
    alternative = two.sided

 NOTE: n is number in *each* group
~~~

15000 visitors in each group seems reasonable; at ~16k visitors a week, that suggests a few weeks of testing. Of course I'm testing 4 fonts (see below), but that still fits in the ~2 months I've allotted for this test.

### Implementation

I had previously drawn on the NYT experiment for my site design:

~~~{.Css}
html {
...
    font-family: Georgia, "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica,
                 Arial, "Lucida Grande", garamond, palatino, verdana, sans-serif;
}
~~~

I had not used Baskerville but [Georgia](!Wikipedia "Georgia (typeface)") since Georgia seemed similar and was convenient, but we'll fix that now. Besides Baskerville & Georgia, we'll omit [Comic Sans](!Wikipedia) (of course), but we can try [Trebuchet](!Wikipedia "Trebuchet MS") for a total of 4 fonts (falling back to Georgia):

~~~{.Html}
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 28
+    <!-- override CSS with a/b test -->
+    <div class="fontfamily_class1"></div>
...
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 121
+      fontfamily: [
+      {
+      name: 'Baskerville',
+      "fontfamily_class1": "<style>html { font-family: Baskerville, Georgia; }</style>",
+      "fontfamily_class2": ""
+      },
+      {
+      name: 'Georgia',
+      "fontfamily_class1": "<style>html { font-family: Georgia; }</style>",
+      "fontfamily_class2": ""
+      },
+      {
+      name: 'Trebuchet',
+      "fontfamily_class1": "<style>html { font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Georgia; }</style>",
+      "fontfamily_class2": ""
+      },
+      {
+      name: 'Helvetica',
+      "fontfamily_class1": "<style>html { font-family: Helvetica, Georgia; }</style>",
+      "fontfamily_class2": ""
+      }
+      ],
~~~

### Results

Running from 14 April 2013 to 16 June 2013:

Font         Type   Visits  Conversion
----------   ------ ------- ----------
Trebuchet    sans   35,473  13.81%
Baskerville  serif  36,021  13.73%
Helvetica    sans   35,656  13.43%
Georgia      serif  35,833  13.31%
             sans   71,129  13.62%
             serif  71,854  13.52%
                    142,983 13.57%

The sample size for each font is 20k higher than I projected due to the enormous popularity of [an analysis of the lifetimes of Google services](Google shutdowns) I finished during the test. Regardless, it's clear that the results - with double the total sample size of the NYT experiment, focused on fewer fonts - are disappointing and there seems to be very little difference between fonts.

### Analysis

Picking the most extreme difference, between Trebuchet and Georgia, the difference is close to the usual definition of statistical-significance:

~~~{.R}
R> prop.test(c(0.1381*35473,0.1331*35833),c(35473,35833))

    2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(0.1381 * 35473, 0.1331 * 35833) out of c(35473, 35833)
X-squared = 3.76, df = 1, p-value = 0.0525
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95% confidence interval:
 -5.394e-05  1.005e-02
sample estimates:
prop 1 prop 2
0.1381 0.1331
~~~

Which naturally implies that the much smaller difference between Trebuchet and Baskerville is not statistically-significant:

~~~{.R}
R> prop.test(c(0.1381*35473,0.1373*36021), c(35473,36021))

    2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(0.1381 * 35473, 0.1373 * 36021) out of c(35473, 36021)
X-squared = 0.0897, df = 1, p-value = 0.7645
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95% confidence interval:
 -0.00428  0.00588
~~~

Since there's only small differences between individual fonts, I wondered if there might be a difference between the two sans-serifs and the two serifs. If we lump the 4 fonts into those 2 categories and look at the small difference in mean conversion rate:

~~~{.R}
R> prop.test(c(0.1362*71129,0.1352*71854), c(71129,71854))

    2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(0.1362 * 71129, 0.1352 * 71854) out of c(71129, 71854)
X-squared = 0.2963, df = 1, p-value = 0.5862
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95% confidence interval:
 -0.002564  0.004564
~~~

Nothing doing there either.

With essentially no meaningful differences between conversion rates, this suggests that however fonts matter, they don't matter for reading duration. So I feel free to pick the font that appeals to me visually, which is Baskerville.

## Line height

I have seen complaints that lines on `gwern.net` are "too closely spaced" or "run together" or "cramped", referring to the [line height](!Wikipedia "Leading") (the CSS property `line-height`). I set the CSS to `line-height: 150%;` to deal with this objection, but this was a simple hack based on rough eyeballing of it, and it was done before I changed the `max-width` and `font-family` settings after the previous testing. So it's worth testing some variants.

Most web design guides seem to suggest a safe default of 120%, rather than my current 150%. If we try to test each decile plus one on the outside, that'd give us 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160 or 6 options, which combined with the expected small effect, would require an unreasonable sample size (and I have nothing in the pipeline I expect might catch fire like the Google analysis and deliver an excess >50k visits). So I'll try just 120/130/140/150, and schedule a similar block of time as fonts (ending the experiment on 16 August 2013, with presumably >70k datapoints).

Just from looking at the miserably small difference between the most extreme percentages ($15.26 - 14.92 = 0.34$%), we can predict that nothing here was statistically-significant:

~~~{.R}
x1 <- 18124; x2 <- 17927; prop.test(c(x1*0.1524, x2*0.1476), c(x1,x2))

    2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(x1 * 0.1524, x2 * 0.1476) out of c(x1, x2)
X-squared = 1.591, df = 1, p-value = 0.2072
~~~

I changed the 150% to 130% for the heck of it, even though the difference between 130 and 150 was trivially small.

## Null test

One of the suggestions in the A/B testing papers was to run a "null" A/B test where the payload is empty but the A/B testing framework is still measuring conversions etc. By definition, the null hypothesis of "no difference" should be true and at an alpha of 0.05, only 5% of the time would the null tests yield a _p_<0.05 (which is very different from the usual situation). The interest here is that it's possible that something is going wrong in one's A/B setup or in general, and so if one gets a "statistically-significant" result, it may be worthwhile investigating this anomaly.

It's easy to switch from the lineheight test to the null test; just rename the variables for Google Analytics, and empty the payloads:

~~~{.Html}
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 30
-    <div class="linewidth_class1"></div>
+    <div class="null_class1"></div>
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 158
-      linewidth: [
+      null: [
+      ...]]
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 160
-      name: 'Line120',
-      "linewidth_class1": "<style>div#content { line-height: 120%;}</style>",
+      name: 'null1',
+      "null_class1": "",
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 165
-      { ...
-      name: 'Line130',
-      "linewidth_class1": "<style>div#content { line-height: 130%;}</style>",
-      "linewidth_class2": ""
-      },
-      {
-      name: 'Line140',
-      "linewidth_class1": "<style>div#content { line-height: 140%;}</style>",
-      "linewidth_class2": ""
-      },
-      {
-      name: 'Line150',
-      "linewidth_class1": "<style>div#content { line-height: 150%;}</style>",
+      name: 'null2',
+      "null_class1": "",
+       ... }
~~~

Since any difference due to the testing framework should be noticeable, this will be a shorter experiment, from 15 August to 29 August.

### Results

While amusingly the first pair of 1k hits resulted in a dramatic 18% vs 14% result, this quickly disappeared into a much more normal-looking set of data:

option _n_    conversion
------ -----  ------
null2  7,359  16.23%
null1  7,488  15.89%
       14,847 16.06%

### Analysis

Ah, but can we reject the null hypothesis that ""==""? In a victory for null-hypothesis-significance-testing, we do not commit a Type I error:

~~~{.R}
R> x1 <- 7359; x2 <- 7488; prop.test(c(x1*0.1623, x2*0.1589), c(x1,x2))

    2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(x1 * 0.1623, x2 * 0.1589) out of c(x1, x2)
X-squared = 0.2936, df = 1, p-value = 0.5879
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95% confidence interval:
 -0.008547  0.015347
~~~

But seriously, it's nice to see that ABalytics does not seem to be broken & favoring either option and any results driven by placement in the array of options.

## Text & background color

As part of the generally monochromatic color scheme, the background was off-white (grey) and the text was black:

~~~{.Css}
html { ...
    background-color: #FCFCFC; /* off-white */
    color: black;
... }
~~~

The hyperlinks, on the other hand, make use of a off-black `color: #303C3C`, partially motivated by Ian Storm Taylor's advice to ["Never Use Black"](http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/). I wonder - should all the text be off-black too? And which combination is best? White/black? Off-white/black? Off-white/off-black? White/off-black? Let's try all 4 combinations here.

### Implementation

The usual:

~~~{.Html}
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 30
-    <div class="underline_class1"></div>
+    <div class="ground_class1"></div>
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 155
-      underline: [
+      ground: [
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 157
-      name: 'underlined',
-      "underline_class1": "<style>a { color: #303C3C; text-decoration: underline; }</style>",
-      "underline_class2": ""
+      name: 'bw',
+      "ground_class1": "<style>html { background-color: white; color: black; }</style>",
+      "ground_class2": ""
hunk ./static/templates/default.html 162
-      name: 'notUnderlined',
-      "underline_class1": "<style>a { color: #303C3C; text-decoration: none; }</style>",
-      "underline_class2": ""
+      name: 'obw',
+      "ground_class1": "<style>html { background-color: white; color: #303C3C; }</style>",
+      "ground_class2": ""
+      },
+      {
+      name: 'bow',
+      "ground_class1": "<style>html { background-color: #FCFCFC; color: black; }</style>",
+      "ground_class2": ""
+      },
+      {
+      name: 'obow',
+      "ground_class1": "<style>html { background-color: #FCFCFC; color: #303C3C; }</style>",
+      "ground_class2": ""
... ]]
~~~

### Data

I am a little curious about this one, so I scheduled a full month and half: 10 September - 20 October. Due to far more traffic than anticipated from submissions to Hacker News, I cut it short by 10 days to avoid wasting traffic on a test which was done (a total _n_ of 231,599 was more than enough). The results:

Version  _n_       Conversion
----     ------    ---------
bw       58,237    12.90%
obow     58,132    12.62%
bow      57,576    12.48%
obw      57,654    12.44%

### Analysis

~~~{.R}
rates <- read.csv(stdin(),header=TRUE)
Black,White,N,Rate
TRUE,TRUE,58237,0.1290
FALSE,FALSE,58132,0.1262
TRUE,FALSE,57576,0.1248
FALSE,TRUE,57654,0.1244

rates$Successes <- rates$N * rates$Rate
rates$Successes <- round(rates$Successes,0)
rates$Failures <-rates$N - rates$Successes

g <- glm(cbind(Successes,Failures) ~ Black * White, data=rates, family="binomial")
summary(g)
...
Coefficients:
                    Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)

BlackTRUE            -0.0128     0.0177   -0.72     0.47
WhiteTRUE            -0.0164     0.0178   -0.92     0.36
BlackTRUE:WhiteTRUE   0.0545     0.0250    2.17     0.03

(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)

    Null deviance:  6.8625e+00  on 3  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance: -1.1758e-11  on 0  degrees of freedom
AIC: 50.4
summary(step(g))
# same thing
~~~

So we can estimate the net effect of the 4 possibilities:

1. Black, White: -0.0128 + -0.0164 + 0.0545 = 0.0253
2. Off-black, Off-white: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
3. Black, Off-white: -0.0128 + 0 + 0 = -0.0128
4. Off-black, White: 0 + -0.0164 + 0 = -0.0164

The results exactly match the data's rankings.

So, this suggests a change to the CSS: we switch the default background color from `#FCFCFC` to `white`, while leaving the default `color` its current `black`.

Reader Lucas asks in the comment sections whether, since we would expect new visitors to the website to be less likely to read a page in full than a returning visitor (who knows what they're in for & probably wants more), whether including such a variable (which is something Google Analytics does track) might improve the analysis. It's easy to ask GA for "New vs Returning Visitor" so I did:

~~~{.R}
rates <- read.csv(stdin(),header=TRUE)
Black,White,Type,N,Rate
FALSE,TRUE,new,36695,0.1058
FALSE,TRUE,old,21343,0.1565
FALSE,FALSE,new,36997,0.1043
FALSE,FALSE,old,21537,0.1588
TRUE,TRUE,new,36600,0.1073
TRUE,TRUE,old,22274,0.1613
TRUE,FALSE,new,36409,0.1075
TRUE,FALSE,old,21743,0.1507

rates$Successes <- rates$N * rates$Rate
rates$Successes <- round(rates$Successes,0)
rates$Failures <-rates$N - rates$Successes

g <- glm(cbind(Successes,Failures) ~ Black * White + Type, data=rates, family="binomial")
summary(g)

Coefficients:
                     Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)         -2.134459   0.013770 -155.01   <2e-16
BlackTRUE           -0.009219   0.017813   -0.52     0.60
WhiteTRUE            0.000837   0.017798    0.05     0.96
BlackTRUE:WhiteTRUE  0.034362   0.025092    1.37     0.17
Typeold              0.448004   0.012603   35.55   <2e-16
~~~

1. B/W: (-0.009219) + 0.000837 + 0.034362 = 0.02598
2. 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
3. B: (-0.009219) + 0 + 0 = -0.009219
4. W: 0 + 0.000837 + 0 = 0.000837

And again, 0.02598 > 0.000837. So as one hopes, thank to randomization, adding a missing covariate doesn't change our conclusion.

## List symbol and font-size

I make heavy use of unordered lists in articles; for no particular reason, the symbol denoting the start of each entry in a list is the little black square, rather than the more common little circle. I've come to find the little squares a little chunky and ugly, so I want to test that. And I just realized that I never tested font size (just type of font), even though increasing font size one of the most common CSS tweaks around. I don't have any reason to expect an interaction between these two bits of designs, unlike the previous A/B test, but I like the idea of getting more out of my data, so I am doing another factorial design, this time not 2x2 but 3x5. The options:

~~~{.Css}
ul { list-style-type: square; }
ul { list-style-type: circle; }
ul { list-style-type: disc; }

html { font-size: 100%; }
html { font-size: 105%; }
html { font-size: 110%; }
html { font-size: 115%; }
html { font-size: 120%; }
~~~

### Implementation

A 3x5 design, or 15 possibilities, does get a little bulkier than I'd like:

~~~{.Html}

~~~

### Data

I halted the A/B test on 27 October because I was noticing clear damage as compared to my default CSS. The results were:

The results are a little confusing in factorial form: it seems pretty clear that `Size` is bad and that 100% performs best, but what's going on with the list icon type? Do we have too little data or is it interacting with the font size somehow? I find it a lot clearer when plotted:

~~~{.R}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Size,Rate,color=Ul,data=rates)
~~~

![Reading rate, split by font size, then by list icon type](/images/2013-10-27-abtesting-ulfontsize.png)

Immediately the negative effect of increasing the font size jumps out, but it's easier to understand the list icon estimates: square performs the best in the 100% (the original default) font size condition but it performs poorly in the other font sizes, which is why it seems to do only medium-well compared to the others. Given how much better 100% performs than the others, I'm inclined to ignore their results and keep the squares.

100% and squares, however, were the original CSS settings, so this means I will make no changes to the existing CSS based on these results.

## Blockquote formatting

Another bit of formatting I've been meaning to test for a while is seeing how well [Readability](http://www.readability.com/)'s pull-quotes next to blockquotes perform, and to check whether my zebra-striping of nested blockquotes is helpful or harmful.

The Readability thing goes like this:

~~~{.Css}
blockquote: : before {
    content: "\201C";
    filter: alpha(opacity=20);
    font-family: "Constantia", Georgia, 'Hoefler Text', 'Times New Roman', serif;
    font-size: 4em;
    left: -0.5em;
    opacity: .2;
    position: absolute;
    top: .25em }
~~~

The current blockquote striping goes thusly:

~~~{.Css}
blockquote, blockquote blockquote blockquote, blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote {
    z-index: -2;
    background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); }
blockquote blockquote, blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote, blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote {
    background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); }
~~~

### Implementation

This is another 2x2 design since we can use the Readability quotes or not, and the zebra-striping or not.

I discovered during this experiment that I could graph the conversion rate of each condition separately:

![Google Analytics view on blockquote factorial test conversions, by day](/images/2013-11-25-abtesting-blockquotehighlighting.png)

What I like about this graph is how it demonstrates some basic statistical points:

1. the more traffic, the smaller sampling error is and the closer the 4 conditions are to their true values as they cluster together. This illustrates how even what *seems* like a large difference based on a large amount of data, may still be - unintuitively - dominated by sampling error
2. day to day, any condition can be on top; no matter which one proves superior and which version is the worst, we can spot days where the worst version looks better than the best version. This illustrates how insidious selection biases or choice of datapoints can be: we can easily lie and show black is white, if we can just manage to cherrypick a little bit.
3. the underlying traffic does not itself appear to be completely stable or consistent. There are a lot of movements which look like the underlying visitors may be changing in composition slightly and responding slightly. This harks back to the paper's warning that for some tests, no answer was possible as the responses of visitors kept changing which version was performing best.

The top-performing variant is the status quo (no Readability-style quote, zebra-striped blocks). So we keep it.

## Font size & ToC background

It was pointed out to me that in my previous font-size test, the clear linear trend may have implied that larger fonts than 100% were bad, but that I was making an unjustified leap in implicitly assuming that 100% was best: if bigger is worse, then mightn't the optimal font size be something *smaller* than 100%, like 95%?

And while the blockquote background coloring is a good idea, per the previous test, what about the other place on `gwern.net` where I use a light background shading: the Table of Contents? Perhaps it would be better with the same background shading as the blockquotes, or no shading?

Finally, because I am tired of just 2 factors, I throw in a third factor to make it really multifactorial. I picked the number-sizing from the existing list of suggestions.

Each factor has 3 variants, giving 27 conditions:

~~~{.Css}
.num { font-size: 85%; }
.num { font-size: 95%; }
.num { font-size: 100%; }

html { font-size: 85%; }
html { font-size: 95%; }
html { font-size: 100%; }

div#TOC { background: #fff; }
div#TOC { background: #eee; }
div#TOC { background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); }

The two size tweaks turn out to be unambiguously negative compared to the status quo (with an almost negligible interaction term probably reflecting reader preference for consistency in sizes of letters and numbers - as one gets smaller, the other does better if it's smaller too). The Table of Contents backgrounds also survive (thanks to the new vs old visitor type covariate adding power): there were 3 background types, `e`/`f`/`r`[gb], and `f`/`r` turn out to have negative coefficients, implying that `e` is best - but `e` is also the status quo, so no change is recommended.

### Multifactorial roundup

At this point it seems worth asking whether running multifactorials has been worthwhile. The analysis is a bit more difficult, and the more factors there are, the harder to interpret. I'm also not too keen on encoding the combinatorial explosion into a big JS array for ABalytics. In my tests so far, have there been many interactions? A quick tally of the `glm()`/`step()` results:

1. Text & background color:

    - original: 2 main, 1 two-way interaction
    - survived: 2 main, 1 two-way interaction
2. List symbol and font-size:

    - original: 3 main, 2 two-way interactions
    - survived: 1 main
3. Blockquote formatting:

    - original: 2 main, 1 two-way
    - survived: 1 main
4. Font size & ToC background:

    - original: 4 mains, 5 two-ways, 2 three-ways
    - survived: 3 mains, 2 two-way

So of the 11 main effects, 9 two-ways, & 2 three-ways, there were confirmed in the reduced models: 7 mains, 3 two-ways (22%), & 0 three-ways (0%). And of the 2 interactions, only the black/white interaction was important (and even there, if I had regressed instead `cbind(Successes, Failures) ~ Black + White`, black & white would still have positive coefficients, they just would not be statistically-significant, and so I would likely have made the same choice as I did with the interaction data available).

This is not a resounding endorsement so far.

## Section header capitalization

3 * 3:

- `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 { text-transform: uppercase; }`
- `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 { text-transform: none; }`
- `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 { text-transform: capitalize; }`
- `div#header h1 { text-transform: uppercase; }`
- `div#header h1 { text-transform: none; }`
- `div#header h1 { text-transform: capitalize; }`

# Appendix
## Covariate impact on power

> Is it important in randomized testing to control for covariates, even powerful ones? A simulation using a website's data suggests not.

In December 2013, I was discussing website testing with another site owner, which monetizes traffic by selling a product, while I just optimize for reading time. He argued (deleting identifying details since I will be using their real traffic & conversion numbers throughout):

> I think a *big* part that gets lost out is the quality of traffic. For our [next website version]
> (still speccing it all out), one of my biggest requirements for A/B testing
> is that all referring traffic must be bucketed and split-test against them.
> Buckets themselves are amorphous - they can be visitors of the same
> resolution, visitors who have bought our guide, etc. But just comparing how
> we did (and our affiliates did) on sales of our S-G Reference (an easy to
> measure metric - our RPU), traffic matters so much. X sent 5x the
> traffic that Y did, yet still generated 25% less sales. That
> would destroy any meaningful A/B testing without splitting up the quality.

I was a little skeptical that this was a major concern much less one worth expensively engineering into a site, and replied:

> Eh. You would lose some power by not correcting for the covariates of
> source, but the randomization would still work and deliver you
> meaningful results. As long as visitors were being randomized into the
> A and B variants, and there was no gross imbalance in cells between
> Y and X, and Y and X visitors didn't react
> differently, you'd still get the right results - just you would need
> more traffic to get the same statistical power. I don't think 25%
> difference between X and Y visitors would even cost you that
> much power...

In particular, if you lost a *lot* of power, wouldn't that imply randomized trials were inefficient or impossible? The point of randomization is that it eliminates the impact of the indefinitely many observed and unobserved variables to let you do causal inference.

### Power simulation

Since this seems like a relatively simple problem, I suspect there is an analytic answer, but I don't know it. So instead, we can set this up as a simulated power analysis: we generate random data where we *force* the hypothesis to be true by construction, we run our planned analysis, and we see how often we get a _p_-value underneath 0.05 (which is the true correct answer, by construction).

Let's say Y's visitors convert at 10%, then X's must convert at 10% * 0.75, as he said, and let's imagine our A/B test of a blue site-design increases sales by 1%. (So in the better version, Y visitors convert at 11% and X convert at 8.5%.) We generate $\frac{n}{4}$ datapoints from each condition (X/blue, X/not-blue, Y/blue, Y/not-blue), and then we do the usual logistic regression looking for a difference in conversion rate, with and without the info about the source. So we regress Conversion ~ Color, to look at what would happen if we had no idea where visitors came from, and then we regress `Conversion ~ Color + Source`. These will spit out _p_-values on the `Color` coefficient which are *almost* the same, but not quite the same: the regression with the `Source` variable is slightly better so it should yield slightly lower _p_-values for `Color`. Then we count up all the times the _p_-value was below the magical amount for each regression, and we see how many statistically-significant _p_-values we lost when we threw out `Source`. Phew!

So we might like to do this for each sample size to get an idea of how they change. _n_=100 may not the same for _n_=10,000. And ideally, for each _n_, we do the random data generation step many times, because it's a simulation and so any particular run may not be representative. Below, I'll look at _n_=1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, and so on up until _n_=10,000. And for each _n_, I'll generate 1000 replicates, which should be pretty accurate.

So at _n_=1000 we don't have decent statistical power to detect our true effect of 1% increase in conversion rate thanks to blue - only 8% of the time will we get our magical _p_<0.05 and rejoice in the knowledge that blue is boss. That's not great, but that's not what we were asking about.

#### Small _n_

Moving on to our original question, we see that the regressions controlling for source had a very similar power as to the regressions which didn't bother. It looks like you may pay a small price of 2% less statistical power, but probably even less than that because so many of the other entries yielded an estimate of 0% penalty. And obviously the penalty gets smaller as sample size increases and a mere 25% difference in conversion rate washes out as noise.

What if we look at smaller samples? say, _n_=12-1012?

As expected, with tiny samples like 12, 22, or 32, the A/B test has essentially 0% power to detect any difference, and so it doesn't matter if one controls for source or not. In the _n_=42+ range, we start seeing some small penalty, but the fluctuations from a 33% penalty to 0% penalty to 50% to 23% to 0% show that once we start nearing _n_=100, the difference barely exists, and the long succession of 1.0000s say that past that, we must be talking a very small power penalty of like 1%.

Those are much bigger conversion differentials than the original 25% estimate, but the loss of power was so minute in the first case that I suspect that the penalty will still be *relatively* small.

I can fix the power analysis by looking at each traffic source separately and tweaking the random generation appropriately with liberal use of copy-paste. For the website, he said 3x500 but there's 3963 hits so I'll assume the remainder is your general organic website traffic. That gives me a total table:

- Email: 500 * 13.72% = 67
- Facebook: 500 * 8.35% = 42
- Twitter: 500 * 1.39% = 7
- organic: 293-(67+42+7) = 177; 3963 - (3*500) = 2463; 177 / 2463 = 7.186%

In the most extreme case (total _n_=1000), where our controlled test's power is 0.105 or 10.5% (well, what do you expect from that small an A/B test?), our test where we throw away the Source info has a power of 0.093 or 9.3%. So we lost 0.1143 or 11% of the power.

### Sample size implication

That's not as bad as I feared when I saw the huge conversion rate differences, but maybe it has a bigger consequence than I guess?

What does this 11% loss translate to in terms of extra sample size?

Well, our original total conversion rate was 6.52%:

~~~{.R}
R> sum((website$N * website$Rate)) / sum(website$N)
[1] 0.0652
~~~

We were examining a hypothetical increase by 1% to 7.52%. A regular 2-proportion power calculation (the closest thing to a binomial in the R standard library)

~~~{.R}
R> power.prop.test(n = 1000, p1 = 0.0652, p2 = 0.0752)

     Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation

              n = 1000
             p1 = 0.0652
             p2 = 0.0752
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.139
     ...
~~~

Its 14% estimate is reasonably close to 10.5% given all the simplifications I'm doing here. So, imagine our 0.139 power here was the victim of the 11% loss, and the *true* power is $x = 0.11x + 0.139$ where then _x_=0.15618. Given the _p1_ and _p2_ for our A/B test, how big would _n_ then have to be to reach our true power?

~~~{.R}
R> power.prop.test(p1 = 0.0652, p2 = 0.0752, power=0.15618)

     Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation

              n = 1178
     ...
~~~

So in this worst-case scenario with small sample size and very different true conversion rates, we would need another 178 page-views/visits to make up for completely throwing out the source covariate. This is usually a doable number of extra page-views.

#### `Gwern.net`

What are the implications for my own A/B tests, with less extreme "conversion" differences? It might be interesting to imagine a hypothetical where my traffic split between my highest conversion traffic source and my lowest, and see how much extra _n_ I must pay in my testing because I decline to figure out how to record source for tested traffic.

Looking at my traffic for the year 26 December 2012-2013, I see that of the top 10 referral sources, the highest converting source is [bulletproofexec.com](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/) traffic at 29.95% of the 9461 visits, and the lowest is [t.co](!Wikipedia) (Twitter) at 8.35% of 15168. We'll split traffic 50/50 between these two sources.

So our power loss is not *too* severe in this worst-case scenario: we lose a mean of 12% of our power, or around half.

We were examining a hypothetical conversion increase by 1% from 19.15% (`mean(c(bulletP, tcoP))`) to 20.15%. A regular 2-proportion power calculation (the closest thing to a binomial in the R standard library)

~~~{.R}
R> power.prop.test(n = 1000, p1 = 0.1915, p2 = 0.2015)

     Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation

              n = 1000
             p1 = 0.1915
             p2 = 0.2015
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.08116
...

~~~

Its 14% estimate is reasonably close to 10.5% given all the simplifications I'm doing here. So, imagine our 0.08116 power here was the victim of the 12% loss, and the *true* power is $x = 0.12x + 0.08116$ where then _x_=0.0922273. Given the _p1_ and _p2_ for our A/B test, how big would _n_ then have to be to reach our true power?

~~~{.R}
R> power.prop.test(p1 = 0.1915, p2 = 0.2015, power=0.0922273)

     Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation

              n = 1265
~~~

So this worst-case scenario means I must spend an extra _n_ of 265 or roughly a fifth of a day's traffic. Since it would probably cost me, on net, far more than a fifth of a day to find an implementation strategy, debug it, and incorporate it into all future analyses, I am happy to continue throwing out the source information & other covariates.
