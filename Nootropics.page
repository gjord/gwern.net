# Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

No effects, alone or mixed with choline+piracetam. This is pretty much as expected from reports about [ALCAR](!Wikipedia), but I had still been hoping for energy boosts or something.

# Adrafinil

A disappointment. Almost as expensive as actual modafinil, with the risk of liver problems, but did nothing whatsoever that I noticed.

# Aniracetam

Very expensive; I noticed minimal improvements when combined with sulbutiamine & piracetam+choline. Definitely not worthwhile for me.

# Beta-phenylethylamine (PEA)

Based on this [_H+_](http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/neuro/nutraceutical-brain-boosting-free-schwag) article/advertisement, I gave a PEA supplement a try. Noticed nothing. Critical commentators pointed out that PEA was notoriously degraded by the digestive system, though Neurvana's 'pro' supplement claimed to avoid that. I guess it doesn't. No need to try it out again, anyway.

# Caffeine

I ordered 400g of 'anhydrous [caffeine](!Wikipedia)' from [smartpowders.com](http://www.smartpowders.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=sp035). Apparently my [oolong tea](!Wikipedia) doesn't contain very much caffeine, so adding half a gram wakes me up a bit. Surprisingly for something with 'anhydrous' in its name, it doesn't seem to dissolve very well.

Caffeine is of course the most famous stimulant around. But consuming 0.5g or more a day, I have discovered the downside: it is addictive and has a nasty withdrawal. (Headaches, decreased motivation, apathy, and generalized unhappiness.) This is in considerable contrast to the other substances I like, such as piracetam or fish oil. I knew about withdrawal of course, but it was not so bad when I was drinking only tea. And the side-effects like jitteriness are worse on caffeine without tea; I chalk this up to the lack of [theanine](!Wikipedia).

I will probably continue to use the caffeine. It's not so bad in conjunction with tea, is very cheap, and I'm already addicted, so why not?

# Choline

Does little alone, but absolutely necessary in conjunction with [piracetam](#Piracetam). In the future, I might try Alpha-GPC instead of the regular cholines; that supposedly has better bioavailability.

# Coconut oil

TODO

# Creatine

[Creatine](!Wikipedia) was another early essay of mine - cheap (because it's so popular with the bodybuilder types), and with a very good safety record. I bought some from Bulk Powders and combined it with my then-current regimen (piracetam+choline).

I'm not a bodybuilder, but my interest was sparked by several studies showing IQ boosts (such as [Rae 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/); however, Rae 2003 was only in vegetarians, who are known to be creatine deficient (much like B vitamins, creatine is usually gotten in one's diet from meat), and the other studies are likewise of subpopulations. [Rawson 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0P-4SHF4KD-5/2/c77ebd9c168b601c62ab0b3c36678689) studied young omnivores who are not stupid or sleep-deprived, and found no mental benefit. The summary of the [DNB ML discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fe4ee2f0c994e40e/d24bcf30c083ec3e) was that Rawson 2008 is a broad null result for healthy young omnivores who aren't idiots. Vegetarians, idiots, the sleep-deprived, and old people may benefit from creatine supplementation.

As I am not the latter, I didn't *really* expect a mental benefit. As it happens, I observed nothing. What surprised me was something I had forgotten about: physical benefits. My performance in [Taekwondo](!Wikipedia) classes suddenly improved - specifically, my endurance increased substantially. Before, classes had left me nearly prostrate at the end, but after, I was weary yet fairly alert and happy. This was driven home to me one day when in a flurry before class, I prepared my customary tea with piracetam, choline & creatine; by the middle of the class, I was feeling faint, had to take a break, and suddenly, thunderstruck, realized that I had absentmindedly forgot to actually drink it! This made me a believer.

# Fish oil

[Fish oil](!Wikipedia) provides benefits relating to general mood and anti-schizophrenia; it is one of the better supplements one can take[^research]. The benefits of omega acids seem to be real: I noticed an effect on [my dual n-back scores](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/78e54d222e2c268b/44526d276379dded).

The price is not as good as multivitamins or melatonin; I took 4 capsules a day for roughly 4000mg of omega acids. The jar of 400 is 100 days' worth, and costs ~$17, or around 17¢ a day. The general health benefits push me over the edge of favoring its indefinite use.

So I looked into what straight liquid would cost; unsurprisingly, they are much more cost-effective than pills (but like with the powders, straight fish oil isn't very appetizing) - I bought 4 bottles (16 fluid ounces each) for [$53.31](http://www.iherb.com/Nature-s-Answer-Liquid-Omega-3-Deep-Sea-Fish-Oil-EPA-DHA-Natural-Orange-Flavor-16-fl-oz-480-ml/7908) total (thanks to coupons & sales), and each bottle lasts around a month and a half for perhaps half a year, or ~$100 for a year's supply. Very reasonable indeed.

# Huperzine-A

No effect. See my [experience report](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/6e35c60f904c2417).

# Hydergine

[Hydergine](!Wikipedia) was another disappointment. I noticed little to nothing that couldn't be normal daily variation.

# Lion's Mane mushroom

_[Hericium erinaceus](!Wikipedia)_ was recommended strongly by several on the [ImmInst.org](http://www.imminst.org/forum/) forums for its long-term benefits to learning, apparently linked to [Nerve growth factor](!Wikipedia). Highly speculative stuff, and it's unclear whether the mushroom powder I bought was the right form to take (ImmInst.org discussions seem to universally assume one is taking an alcohol or hotwater extract). It tasted nice, though, and I mixed it into my sleeping pills (which contain melatonin & tryptophan). I'll probably never know whether the $30 for 0.5lb was well-spent or not.

# Lithium

[Lithium](!Wikipedia) has a lot of interesting properties^[eg. see _Discover_'s ["The Metal Marvel That Has Mended Brains for 50 Years"](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/the-brain-2/27-metal-marvel-mended-brains-50-years-lithium/), or its connection to [DHA](!Wikipedia "Docosahexaenoic acid") and thus fish oil: ["How lithium works in the brain"](http://machineslikeus.com/news/how-lithium-works-brain)] besides its famous effectiveness for manic-depression. [Lithium orotate](!Wikipedia) is sold commercially in low-doses; I purchased 200 pills with 5mg of lithium each. To put this dosage in comparison, the [therapeutic](!Wikipedia "Lithium pharmacology") doses of lithium are roughly 100x higher (around 500mg), while the natural drinking water levels shown to [decrease crimes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) or [suicides](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/5/464) peak at ~0.5mg or >10x less. The pills are small and tasteless, and not at all hard to take.

Some suggested that the lithium would turn me into a 'zombie'. (There are serious negative effects to taking a lot of lithium - [2-4 grams will trash](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) your long-term memory. But at 5mg for 200 pills, I'd have to eat every one to get up to 1 gram, so I'm not worried about overdosing.) To test this, I took on day 1 & 2 no less than 4 pills or 20mg as a 'attack dose'; I didn't notice any significant change in emotional affect or energy levels. It may've helped my motivation, though I am also trying out the tyrosine.

Some weeks later, I'm still not sure. When I began putting all of my nootropic powders into pill-form, I put half a lithium pill in each, and nevertheless ran out of lithium fairly quickly (3kg of piracetam makes for >4000 OO-size pills); those capsules were buried at the bottom of the bucket under lithium-less pills. In effect, I suddenly went cold-turkey on lithium. Reflecting on the past 2 weeks, I seem to have been less optimistic and productive, with items lingering on my TODO list that I had been finding easier. An effect? Possibly. If I ever develop some good metrics for measuring general 'getting things done'-iveness, I should revisit lithium.

# Melatonin

See [Melatonin]().

# Modafinil

See [Modafinil]() for background.

Here are the notes I jotted down while trying out modafinil back in November 2009. I didn't make any effort to write sensibly, so this makes my lucidity seem much worse than it actually was:

Thursday: 3g piracetam/4g choline bitartate at 1; 1 200mg modafinil at 2:20; noticed a 'leveling' of fatigue by 3:30; dry eyes? no bad after taste or anything. a little light-headed by 4:30, but mentally clear and focused. wonder if light-headedness is due simply to missing lunch and not modafinil. 5:43: noticed my foot jiggling - doesn't usually jiggle while in piracetam/choline. 7:30: starting feeling a bit jittery & manic - not much or to a problematic level but definitely noticeable; but then, that often happens when I miss lunch & dinner. 12:30: bedtime. Can't sleep even with 3mg of melatonin! Subjectively, I toss & turn (in part thanks to my cat) until 4:30, when I really wake up. I hang around bed for another hour & then give up & get up. After a shower, I feel fairly normal, strangely, though not as good as if I had truly slept 8 hours. The lesson here is to pay attention to wikipedia when it says the half-life is 12-15 hours! About 6AM I take 200mg; all the way up to 2pm I feel increasingly less energetic and unfocused, though when I do apply myself I think as well as ever. Not fixed by food or tea or piracetam/choline. I want to be up until midnight, so I take half a pill of 100mg and chew it (since I'm not planning on staying up all night and I want it to work relatively soon). From 4-12PM, I notice that today as well my heart rate is elevated; I measure it a few times and it seems to average to ~70BPM, which is higher than normal, but not high enough to concern me. I stay up to midnight fine, take 3mg of melatonin at 12:30, and have no trouble sleeping; I think I fall asleep around 1. Alarm goes off at 6, I get up at 7:15 and take the other 100mg. Only 100mg/half-a-pill because I don't want to leave the half laying around in the open, and I'm curious whether 100mg + ~5 hours of sleep will be enough after the last 2 days. Maybe next weekend I'll just go without sleep entirely to see what my limits are.

In general, I feel a little bit less alert, but still close to normal. By 6PM, I have a mild headache, but I try out 30 rounds of gbrainy (haven't played it in months) and am surprised to find that I reach an all-time high; no idea whether this is due to DNB or not, since Gbrainy is very heavily 'crystallized' (half the challenge disappears as you learn how the problems work), but it does indicate I'm not deluding myself about mental ability. (To give a figure: my last score well before I did any DNB was 64, and I was doing well that day; on modafinil, I had a 77.) I figure the headache might be food related, eat, and by 7:30 the headache is pretty much gone and I'm fine up to midnight.
I took 1.5mg of melatonin, and went to bed at ~1:30AM; I woke up around 6:30, took a modafinil pill/200mg, and felt pretty reasonable. By noon my mind started to feel a bit fuzzy, and lunch didn't make much of it go away. I've been looking at studies, and users seem to degrade after 30 hours; I started on mid-Thursday, so call that 10 hours, then 24 (Friday), 24 (Saturday), and 14 (Sunday), totaling 72hrs with <20hrs sleep; this might be equivalent to 52hrs with no sleep, and [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Modafinil") writes:

> One study of helicopter pilots suggested that 600 mg of modafinil given in three doses can be used to keep pilots alert and maintain their accuracy at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep.[60] However, significant levels of nausea and vertigo were observed. Another study of fighter pilots showed that modafinil given in three divided 100 mg doses sustained the flight control accuracy of sleep-deprived F-117 pilots to within about 27 percent of baseline levels for 37 hours, without any considerable side effects.[61] In an 88-hour sleep loss study of simulated military grounds operations, 400 mg/day doses were mildly helpful at maintaining alertness and performance of subjects compared to placebo, but the researchers concluded that this dose was not high enough to compensate for most of the effects of complete sleep loss.

If I stop tonight and do nothing Monday (and I sleep the normal eight hours and do not pay any penalty), then that'll be 4 out of 5 days on modafinil, each saving 3 or 4 hours. Each day took one pill which cost me $1.20, but each pill saved let's call it 3.5 hours; if I value my time at minimum wage, or 7.25/hr (federal minimum wage), then that 3.5 hours is worth $25.37, which is much more than $1.20, ~21x more.

My mental performance continues as before; curiously, I get an even higher score on Gbrainy, despite being sure I was less sharp than yesterday. Either I'm wrong about that, or Gbrainy is even more trainable than I thought. I go to bed Sunday around 1AM, and get up around 8AM (so call it 6 or 7 hours).

Monday: It's a long day ahead of me, so I take 200mg. Reasonable performance.

Tuesday: I went to bed at 1am, and first woke up at 6am, and I wrote down a dream; the lucid dreaming book I was reading advised that waking up in the morning and then going back for a short nap often causes lucid dreams, so I tried that - and wound up waking up at 10am with no dreams at all. Oops. I take a pill, but the whole day I don't feel so hot, although my conversation and arguments seem as cogent as ever. I'm also having a terrible time focusing on any actual work. At 8 I take another; I'm behind on too many things, and it looks like I need an all-nighter to catch up. The dose is no good; at 11, I still feel like at 8, possibly worse, and I take another along with the choline+piracetam (which makes a total of 600mg for the day). Come 12:30, and I disconsolately note that I don't seem any better, although I still seem to understand the IQ essays I am reading. I wonder if this is tolerance to modafinil, or perhaps sleep catching up to me? Possibly it's just that I don't remember what the quasi-light-headedness of modafinil felt like. I feel this sort of zombie-like state without change to 4am, so it must be doing something, when I give up and go to bed, getting up at 7:30 without too much trouble. Some N-backing at 9am gives me some low scores (24%,40%) but also some pretty high scores (71%,67%), which suggests I can perform normally if I concentrate. I take another pill and am fine the rest of the day, going to bed at 1am as usual.

Thursday: this is an important day where I really need to be awake. I'm up around 8, take a pill, and save one for later; I'll take half a pill at noon and the other half at 2. This works very well, and I don't feel tired well up to midnight, even though I spent an hour walking.

Friday: alarm clock woke me at 7:40, but I somehow managed to go back to sleep until 9:40. Perhaps sleep inertia is building up despite the modafinil. Another pill. I am in general noticing less effect, but I'll not take any this weekend to see whether I have simply gotten used to it.

Sat/Sun: bed at 1/2AM, awake at 10/11 respectively. Generally unmotivated.

Mon: went to bed at 11:30 Sun, woke at 7:30 and dozed to 8. 200mg at 8:30

(On a sidenote, I think I understand now why modafinil doesn't lead to a _[Beggars in Spain](!Wikipedia)_ scenario; BiS includes massive IQ and motivation boosts as part of the Sleepless modification. Just adding 8 hours a day doesn't do the world-changing trick, no more than some researchers living to 90 and others to 60 has lead to the former taking over. If everyone were suddenly granted the ability to never need sleep, many of them would have no idea what to do with the extra 8 or 9 hours and might well be destroyed by the gift; it takes a lot of motivation to make good use of the time, and if one cannot, then it is a curse akin to the stories of immortals who yearn for death - they yearn because life is not a blessing to them, though that is a fact more about them than life.)

# Piracetam

So as you may remember, I bought 500g of [piracetam](!Wikipedia) from <http://www.smartpowders.com>, and I've tried it out for several days (started on 7 September 2009, and used it steadily up to mid-December). I've varied my dose from 3 grams to 12 grams (at least, I think the little scoop measures in grams), taking them in my tea or bitter fruit juice (cranberry works best, although orange juice masks it pretty well). 3 grams (alone) didn't seem to do much of anything while 12 grams gave me a nasty headache. I also ate 2 or 3 eggs a day.

Subjectively, I don't notice drastic changes. Here's what I do notice:

- My thinking seems a little clearer
- I'm not so easy to tire - I went through a month's worth of my Wikipedia watchlist with less fatigue than usual, and n-backing doesn't seem so tiring.
- [DNB](!Wikipedia "Dual N-back")-wise, eyeballing my stats file seems to indicate a small increase: when I compare peak scores D4B scores, I see mostly 50s and a few 60s before piracetam, and after starting piracetam, a few 70s mixed into the 50s and 60s. Natural increase from training? Dunno - I've been stuck on D4B since June, so 5 or 10% in a week or 3 seems a little suspicious. The full list of scores from then to now is:
> 28,61,36,25,61,57,39,56,23,37,24,50,54,32,50,33,16,42,41,40,34,33,31,65,23,36,29,51,46,31,45,52,30,50,29,36,57,60,34,48,32,41,48,34,51,40,53,73,56,53,53,57,46,50,35,50,60,62,30,60,48,46,52,60,60,48,47,34,50,51,45,54,70,48,61,43,53,60,44,57,50,50,52,37,55,40,53,48,50,52,44,50,50,38,43,66,40,24,67,60,71,54,51,60,41,58,20,28,42,53,59,42,31,60,42,58,36,48,53,46,25,53,57,60,35,46,32,26,68,45,20,51,56,48,25,62,50,54,47,42,55,39,60,44,32,50,34,60,47,70,68,38,47,48,70,51,42,41,35,36,39,23,50,46,44,56,50,39
- The other day, I also noticed I was fidgeting less
- After a week or two, I *think* I noticed better reflexes - both in catching falling cups and the [saccading](!Wikipedia "Saccade") in BW seems slightly easier. But I could be imagining this since I just saw an Erowid report mentioning better reflexes & I may've read that one before I started. (Darn those subconscious impressions and memories! :)

After 7 days, I ordered a kg of [choline](!Wikipedia) bitartrate from <http://www.bulkpowders.com>. I figured I couldn't fairly test piracetam without some regular choline - the eggs might not be enough, might be the wrong kind, etc. It has a quite distinctly fishy smell, but the actual taste is more citrusy, and it seems to neutralize the piracetam taste in tea (which makes things much easier for me).

The first day (22 September) I took ~10g since I was taking 5g of piracetam; I wound up with some diarrhea & farting. Oops.

On the plus side:
- I noticed the less-fatigue thing to a greater extent, getting out of my classes much less tired than usual. (Caveat: my sleep schedule recently changed for the saner recently, so it's possible that's responsible. I think it's more the piracetam+choline, though.)
- One thing I wasn't expecting was a decrease in my appetite - nobody had mentioned that in their reports.I don't like being bothered by my appetite (I know how to eat fine without it reminding me), so I count this as a plus.
- Fidgeting was reduced further

The second day I went with ~6g of choline; much less intestinal distress, but similar effects vis-a-vis fidgeting, loss of appetite, & reduced fatigue.

So in general I thought this was a positive experience, but I'm not sure it was worth $40 for ~2 months' worth, and it was tedious consuming it.

# Sulbutiamine

[2 experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/an862/whos_had_experience_with_sulbutiamine/) with [sulbutiamine](!Wikipedia) on Reddit.

My general impression is positive; it does seem to help with endurance and extended the effect of piracetam+choline, but is not as effective as that combo. At $20 for 30g, I'm not sure it's worthwhile, but I think at $10 it would probably be worthwhile.

It's worth noting that sulbutiamine reports vary dramatically, and it seems possible that some people are thiamine-deficient and so would disproportionately; [SilasBarta](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2q0/intelligence_amplification_open_thread/2mv4?c=1) noticed little to nothing (like me), but [Jimrandomh](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kl/open_thread_august_2010_part_2/2j0z?c=1) reports his life was transformed (and he suspects that his diabetes caused or exacerbated a deficiency).

# Tryptophan

[Tryptophan](!Wikipedia) is in a sense redundant with taking [melatonin](#Melatonin), since melatonin is one of the most prominent metabolites of tryptophan. Nevertheless, subjectively I seem to sleep better by taking 1.5mg of melatonin & 0.5g of tryptophan than I do by taking, say, 3mg of melatonin.

One of the other suggested benefits is for boosting serotonin levels; low levels of serotonin are implicated in a number of issues like depression. I'm not yet sure whether tryptophan has helped with motivation or happiness. Trial and error has taught me that it's a bad idea to take tryptophan in the morning or afternoon, however, even smaller quantities like 0.25g. Like melatonin, the dose-response curve is a U: ~1g is great and induces multiple vivid dreams for me, but ~1.5g leads to an awful night and a headache the next day that was worse, if anything, than melatonin.

Taking the tryptophan is fairly difficult. The powder as supplied by BulkNutrition is *extraordinarily* dry and fine; it seems to be positively [hydrophobic](!Wikipedia). The first time I tried to swallow a teaspoon, I nearly coughed it out - the power had seemed to explode in my mouth and go down my lungs. Thenceforth I made sure to have a mouth of water first. After a while, I took a different tack: I mixed in as much [_hericium_](#lions-mane-mushroom) as would fit in the container. The mushroom powder is wetter and chunkier than the tryptophan, and seems to reduce the problem. Combining the mix with chunks of melatonin inside a pill works even better.

# Tyrosine

[Tyrosine](!Wikipedia) is an amino acid; people on the Imminst.org forums (as well as Wikipedia) suggest that it helps with energy and coping with stress. I ordered 4oz to try it out, and I began taking 1g with my usual caffeine+piracetam+choline mix. It does not dissolve easily in hot water, and is very chalky and not especially tasty. I have not noticed any particular effects from it.

# TODO

- [Naringenin](!Wikipedia) - Timothy Ferriss in excerpt from _Four-hour Body_ claims it extends effectiveness of caffeine (how to buy - capsule? grape fruit concentrate?)

# 3 years supply in pill form

Powders are too annoying, and pills expensive in bulk. So since I'm making my own pills, I might as well make a custom formulation using the ones I've found personally effective. And since making pills is tedious, I want to not have to do it again for years. 3 years seems like a good interval - 1095 days. Since one is often busy and mayn't take that day's pills (there are enough ingredients it has to be multiple pills), it's safe to round it down to a nice even 1000 days.

So, we omit tryptophan because it seems most useful for sleeping and this is a stimulus pill meant for daytime usage. That leaves from the above the following, with some basic commercial specs from the usual retailers:

We calculate how many days each unit gets us simply by dose divided by dose per day. We get quite a range; with some products, we only need 4 units to cover at least 1000 days, but we need 100 units for modafinil!

Ingredient        Units   Cost
----------------  -----   ----
aniracetam        6       $300
caffeine          5       $90
choline citrate   4       $68

sulbutiamine      9       $180
theanine          5       $50

Sum total, $1644, or $1.65 per day for the ingredients.

But how many pills does this make and how much do those pills cost?

[Capsule Connection](http://www.capsuleconnection.com/) sells 1000 00 pills (the largest pills) for $9. I already have a pill machine, so that doesn't count (a sunk cost). If we sum the grams per day column from the first table, we get 9.75 grams a day. Each 00 pill can take around 0.75 grams, so we need 13 pills. (Creatine is very bulky, alas.) 13 pills per day for 1000 days is 13,000 pills, and 1,000 pills is $9 so we need 13 units and 13 times 9 is $117.

Redoing the above, the total expense is $1761 or $1.76 per day.

13 pills a day sounds like a lot, and $1.76 is actually a fair amount per day compared to what most people take. If I couldn't swing a round $1800 (even to cover years of consumption), how would I economize?

Looking at the prices, the overwhelming expense is for modafinil. It's a powerful stimulant - possibly the single most effective ingredient in the list - but dang expensive. If we drop it, the cost drops by a full $800 from $1761 to $961 (almost halving) and to $0.96 per day. A remarkable difference, and if one were genetically insensitive to modafinil, one would definitely want to remove it.

On the other metric, suppose we removed the creatine? Dropping 4 grams of material means we only need to consume 5.75 grams a day, covered by 8 pills (compared to 13 pills). We save 5,000 pills, which would have cost $45 and also don't spend the $68 for the creatine; assuming a modafinil formulation, that drops our $1761 down to $1648 or $1.65 a day. Or we could remove both the creatine and modafinil, for a grand total of $848 or $0.85 a day.

[^research]: it is at the top of the [supplement snake oil](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/) list thanks to tons of correlations eg. ["Teenage Boys Who Eat Fish At Least Once A Week Achieve Higher Intelligence Scores"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309092957.htm), anti-inflammatory properties (see ["Fish Oil May Fight Breast Cancer"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/61005/title/Fish_oil_may_fight_breast_cancer), ["Walnuts slow prostate cancer"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/57701/title/Science_%2B_the_Public__Walnuts_slow_prostate_cancer_growth), ["Benefits of omega-3 fatty acids tally up"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/55362/title/Benefits_of_omega-3_fatty_acids_tally_up)).

    But like any other supplement, there are negative studies like ["Fish oil fails to hold off heart arrhythmia "](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/65600/title/Fish_oil_fails_to_hold_off_heart_arrhythmia) or ["other reports cast doubt on a protective effect against dementia"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/67709/title/2010_Science_News_of_the_Year_Nutrition) or ["Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn’t Make Babies Smart"](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html) or ["...Supplementation with DHA compared with placebo did not slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease."](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/304/17/1903.abstract).
