description: Notes on nootropics I tried, and my experiments
tags: nootropics, psychology, experiments, DNB
...

A record of [nootropics](!Wikipedia)^[No entheogens or hallucinogens; those are not the kind of psychoactives that interest me. I also try to stay on the right side of the law, although this can be difficult and limits my options.] I have tried, with thoughts about which ones worked and did not work for me. These anecdotes should be considered only as anecdotes, and one's efforts with nootropics a hobby to put only limited amounts of time into; for an ironic counterpoint, I suggest the reader listen to [a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGxPHolNU3c) of [Jonathan Coulton](!Wikipedia)'s ["I Feel Fantastic"](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/index.php/I_Feel_Fantastic) while reading.

Your mileage *will* vary. There are so many parameters and interactions in the brain that any of them could be [the bottleneck](!Wikipedia "Liebig's law of the minimum") or responsible pathway, and one could fall prey to the common U-shaped [dose-response curve](!Wikipedia) (eg. [Yerkes-Dodson law](!Wikipedia)) which may imply that the smartest are those who benefit *least*[^equalizing] but ultimately they all cash out in a very few subjective assessments like 'energetic' or 'motivated', with even apparently precise descriptions like 'working memory' or 'verbal fluency' not telling you much about what the nootropic *actually* did. It's tempting to list the nootropics that worked for *you* and tell everyone to go use them, but that is merely [generalizing from one example](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) (and the more nootropics - or meditation styles, or self-help books, or 'getting things done' systems - you try, the stronger the temptation is to [evangelize](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/)). The best you can do is read all the testimonials and studies and use that to prioritize your list of nootropics to try. You don't know in advance which ones will pay off and which will be wasted. You *can't* know in advance.

[^equalizing]: More than once I have seen results indicating that high-IQ types benefit the least from random nootropics; [modafinil](Modafinil#fn14) may be one such nootropic (see ["Cognitive effects of modafinil in student volunteers may depend on IQ"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16140369) ([PDF](http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&ID=6624&DocPartID=6148)), Randall et al 2005), which mentions:

    > "Similarly, [Mehta et al. (2000)](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/assets/default/files/pdf/Mehta2000.pdf) noted that the positive effects of methylphenidate (40 mg) on spatial working memory performance were greatest in those volunteers with lower baseline working memory capacity. In a study of the effects of ginkgo biloba in healthy young adults, [Stough et al. (2001)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11466162) found improved performance in the Trail-Making Test A only in the half with the lower verbal IQ."

    From ["Why Aren't We Smarter Already: Evolutionary Trade-Offs and Cognitive Enhancements"](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/academic/thills/thills/hillspublications/hillshertwig2011cdps.pdf), Hills & Hertwig 2011:

    > "For illustration, consider amphetamines, Ritalin, and modafinil, all of which have been proposed as cognitive enhancers of attention. These drugs exhibit some positive effects on cognition, especially among individuals with lower baseline abilities. However, individuals of normal or above-average cognitive ability often show negligible improvements or even decrements in performance following drug treatment (for details, see [de Jongh, Bolt, Schermer, & Olivier, 2008](http://radian.org/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/brain-botox.pdf "Botox for the brain: Enhancement of cognition, mood and pro-social behavior and blunting of unwanted memories")). For instance, Randall, Shneerson, and File (2005) found that modafinil improved performance only among individuals with lower IQ, not among those with higher IQ. [Farah, Haimm, Sankoorikal, and Chatterjee (2009)](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=neuroethics_pubs "When we enhance cognition with Adderall, do we sacrifice creativity? A preliminary study") found a similar nonlinear relationship of dose to response for amphetamines in a remote-associates task, with low-performing individuals showing enhanced performance but high-performing individuals showing reduced performance. Such ∩-shaped dose-response curves are quite common (see [Cools & Robbins, 2004](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/362/1825/2871.full.pdf "Chemistry of the adaptive mind"))"

I do recommend a few things, like [modafinil](Modafinil) or [melatonin](Melatonin), to many people. (It's also usually a good idea to get powders, no matter what one is using[^powder].) Some of those people are helped; some have told me that they tried and the suggestion did little or nothing. I view nootropics as akin to a biological lottery; one good discovery pays for all. I forge on in the hopes of further striking gold in my unique biology. Your mileage will vary. All you have to do, all you can do is to [just try it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5a5/no_seriously_just_try_it/). Most of my experiences were in my 20s as a 5'11 white male weighing 180-205lbs, fitness varying from not-so-fit to pretty fit; in rough order of *personal* effectiveness, I rank them as follows:

1. [Modafinil](#modafinil)/[armodafinil](#armodafinil)
2. [Melatonin](#melatonin)
3. [Caffeine](#caffeine)+[theanine](#theanine)
4. [Piracetam](#piracetam)+choline
5. [Vitamin D](#vitamin-d)
6. [Sulbutiamine](#sulbutiamine)
7. [Fish oil](#fish-oil)

[^powder]: With the more subtle nootropics, poor shopping can lead to the price per dose becoming so high that they are not cost-effective; this does not have to be the case.

    This tendency is exacerbated by general inefficiencies in the nootropics market - they are manufactured for vastly less than they sell for, although the margins aren't as high as they are in other supplement markets, and not nearly [as](http://www.economist.com/node/9414607?story_id=9414607) [comical](http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/economist-world-cocaine-prices.jpg) as illegal recreational drugs. (_Global Price Fixing: Our Customers are the Enemy_ (Connor 2001) briefly covers the vitamin cartel that operated for most of the 20th century, forcing food-grade vitamins prices up to well over 100x the manufacturing cost.) For example, the notorious Timothy Ferriss (of _The Four-hour Work Week_) advises imitators to find a niche market with very high margins which they can insert themselves into as middlemen and reap the profits; one of his first businesses specialized in... nootropics and bodybuilding. Or, when Smart Powders - usually one of the cheapest suppliers - was dumping its piracetam in a fire sale of half-off after the FDA warning, its owner mentioned on forums that the piracetam was *still* profitable (and that he didn't really care because selling to bodybuilders was *so* lucrative); this was because while SP was selling 2kg of piracetam for ~$90, Chinese suppliers were offering piracetam on [AliBaba](!Wikipedia) for $30 a kilogram or a third of that in bulk. (Of course, you need to order in quantities like 30kg - this is more or less the only problem the middlemen retailers solve.) It goes without saying that premixed pills or products are even more expensive than the powders.

Somewhat ironically given the stereotypes, while I was in college I dabbled very little in nootropics, sticking to melatonin and tea. Since then I have come to find nootropics intellectually interesting for more than just their utility.

They shed light on [issues](Drug heuristics) in philosophy of biology & evolution, argue against naive psychological dualism and for materialism, offer [cases in point](Melatonin#health-performance) on the history of technology & civilization or recent [psychology theories](Melatonin#self-discipline) about addiction & willpower, challenge our understanding of the [validity](DNB%20FAQ#fn51) of statistics and psychology - where they don't offer [nifty little problems](Modafinil#ordering-behavior) in statistics and economics themselves, and are excellent fodder for the young [Quantified Self](!Wikipedia) movement^[For example, I am have used my [Zeo]() to measure the effects of [melatonin](Zeo#melatonin-analysis) or of double-blinded [vitamin D](Zeo#vitamin-d) on my Zeo sleep data; the latter is novel and interesting.]; modafinil itself demonstrates the little-known fact that [sleep](!Wikipedia) has no accepted evolutionary explanation. (The hard drugs also have more ramifications than one might expect: how can one understand the history of Southeast Asia and the Vietnamese War without [reference to heroin](!Wikipedia "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia"), or more contemporaneously, how can one understand the lasting appeal of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the unpopularity & corruption of the central government without reference to the Taliban's frequent anti-drug campaigns or the drug-funded warlords of the [Northern Alliance](!Wikipedia)?)

# Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

No effects, alone or mixed with choline+piracetam. This is pretty much as expected from reports about [ALCAR](!Wikipedia) ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/L-Carnitine/)), but I had still been hoping for energy boosts or something. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Adderall

[Adderall](!Wikipedia) is a mix of 4 [amphetamine](!Wikipedia) salts, and not much better than the others (but perhaps less addictive); as such, like [caffeine](#caffeine) or [methamphetamine](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v37/n3/full/npp2011276a.html), it is not strictly a nootropic but a cognitive enhancer. I ordered 10x10mg Adderall IR off [Silk Road]() ([Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Silk Road (anonymous marketplace)")). On the 4th day after confirmation from seller, the package arrived. It was a harmless looking little padded mailer. Adderall as promised: 10 blue pills with markings, in a double ziplock baggy (reasonable, it's not cocaine or anything). They matched pretty much exactly the descriptions of the generic I had found online. (Surprisingly, apparently both the brand name and the generic are manufactured by the same pharmacorp.)

I took the first pill at 12:48 pm. 1:18, still nothing really - head is a little foggy if anything. later noticed a steady sort of mental energy lasting for hours (got a good deal of reading and programming done) until my midnight walk, when I still felt alert, and had trouble sleeping. (Zeo reported a ZQ of 100, but a full 18 minutes awake, 2 or 3 times the usual amount.)

At this point, I began thinking about what I was doing. Black-market Adderall is fairly expensive; $4-10 a pill vs prescription prices which run more like \$60 for 120 20mg pills. It would be a bad idea to become a fan without being quite sure that it is delivering bang for the buck. Now, why the piracetam mix as the placebo as opposed to my other available powder, [creatine](#creatine) powder, which has much smaller mental effects? Because the question for me is not whether the Adderall works (I am quite sure that the amphetamines have effects!) but whether it works *better* for me than my cheap legal standbys (piracetam & caffeine)? (Does Adderall have [marginal advantage](http://web.archive.org/web/20100704174112/http://interactive.usc.edu/members/splott/2009/02/the_marginal_advantage.html) for me?) Hence, I want to know whether Adderall is *better than* my piracetam mix. People frequently underestimate the power of placebo effects, so it's worth testing. (Unfortunately, it seems that there is experimental evidence that people on Adderall know they are on Adderall and also believe they have improved performance, when they do not[^ilieva]. So the blind testing does not buy me as much as it could.)

[^ilieva]: This is reportedly the result of 'Ilieva, I., Boland, J., Chatterjee, A. & Farah, M.J. (2010). "Adderall's perceived and actual effects on healthy people’s cognition". Poster presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA'; blogger [Casey Schwartz](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/12/21/adderall-concentration-benefits-in-doubt-new-study.html) describes it:

    > "In a recent study at Dr. Martha Farah's lab at the University of Pennsylvania, researchers have added a new layer to the "smart pill" conversation. Adderall, they've found, makes you think you're doing better than you actually are....Those subjects who had been given Adderall were significantly more likely to report that the pill had caused them to do a better job....But the results of the new University of Pennsylvania study, funded by the U.S. Navy and not yet published but presented at the annual Society for Neuroscience conference last month, are consistent with much of the existing research. As a group, no overall statistically significant improvement or impairment was seen as a result of taking Adderall. The research team tested 47 subjects, all in their 20s, all without a diagnosis of ADHD, on a variety of cognitive functions, from working memory—how much information they could keep in mind and manipulate—to raw intelligence, to memories for specific events and faces. Each subject was tested both while on Adderall and on a placebo; in each condition, the subjects didn't know which kind of pill they were receiving. The researchers did come up with one significant finding. The last question they asked their subjects was: "How and how much did the pill influence your performance on today's tests?" Those subjects who had been given Adderall were significantly more likely to report that the pill had caused them to do a better job on the tasks they'd been given, even though their performance did not show an improvement over that of those who had taken the placebo. According to Irena Ilieva, the Ph.D. candidate who led the research team, it's the first time since the 1960s that a study on the effects of amphetamine, a close cousin of Adderall, has asked how subjects perceive the effect of the drug on their performance."

## Adderall blind testing

### Blinding yourself

But how to blind *myself*? I used my pill maker to make 9 OO pills of piracetam mix, and then 9 OO pills of piracetam mix+the Adderall, then I put them in a baggy. The idea is that I can blind myself as to what pill I am taking that day since at the end of the day, I can just look in the baggy and see whether a placebo or Adderall pill is missing: the big capsules are transparent so I can see whether there is a crushed-up blue Adderall in the end or not. If there are fewer Adderall than placebo, I took an Adderall, and vice-versa. Now, since I am checking at the end of each day, I also need to remove or add the opposite pill to maintain the ratio and make it easy to check the next day; more importantly I need to replace or remove a pill, because otherwise the odds will be skewed and I will *know* how they are skewed. (Imagine I started with 4 Adderalls and 4 placebos, and then 3 days in a row I draw placebos but I don't add or remove any pills; obviously the next day, there's only a small chance I will get a placebo...)

This is only one of many ways to blind myself; for example, instead of using one bag, one could use two bags and instead blindly pick a bag to take a pill out of, balancing contents as before. (See also my [Vitamin D](Zeo#vitamin-d) and [day modafinil](#modalert-blind-day-trial) trials.)

### Results

1. Began double-blind trial. Today I took one pill blindly at 1:53 PM. at the end of the day when I have written down my impressions and guess whether it was one of the Adderall pills, then I can look in the baggy and count and see whether it was. there are many other procedures one can take to blind oneself (have an accomplice mix up a sequence of pills and record what the sequence was; don't count & see but blindly take a photograph of the pill each day, etc.) Around 3, I begin to wonder whether it was Adderall because I am arguing more than usual on IRC and my heart rate seems a bit high just sitting down. 6 PM: I've started to think it was a placebo. My heart rate is back to normal, I am having difficulty concentrating on long text, and my appetite has shown up for dinner (although I didn't have lunch, I don't think I had lunch yesterday and yesterday the hunger didn't show up until past 7). Productivity wise, it has been a normal day. All in all, I'm not too sure, but I think I'd guess it was Adderall [with 40% confidence](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3138) (another way of saying 'placebo with 60% confidence'). When I go to examine the baggie at 8:20 PM, I find out... it was an Adderall pill after all. Oh dear. One little strike against Adderall that I guessed wrong. It may be that the problem is that I am intrinsically a little worse today (normal variation? come down from Adderall?).

    So, a change to the protocol. I will take a pill every other day - a day to washout and reacclimate to 'baseline', and then an experimental day. In subsequent entries, assume there was either a at least one intervening break or placebo day.
2. Took random pill at 2:02 PM. Went to lunch half an hour afterwards, talked until 4 - more outgoing than my usual self. I continued to be pretty energetic despite not taking my caffeine+piracetam pills, and though it's now 12:30 AM and I listened to TAM YouTube videos all day while reading, I feel pretty energetic and am reviewing Mnemosyne cards. I am pretty confident the pill today was Adderall. Hard to believe placebo effect could do this much for this long or that normal variation would account for this. I'd say [90% confidence](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3139) it was Adderall. I do some more Mnemosyne, typing practice, and reading in a Montaigne book, and finally get tired and go to bed around 1:30 AM or so. I check the baggie when I wake up the next morning, and sure enough, it had been an Adderall pill. That makes me 1 for 2.
3. Took pill 1:27 PM. At 2 my hunger gets the best of me (despite my usual tea drinking and caffeine+piracetam pills) and I eat a large lunch. This makes me suspicious it was placebo - on the previous days I had noted a considerable appetite-suppressant effect. 5:25 PM: I don't feel unusually tired, but nothing special about my productivity. 8 PM; no longer so sure. Read and excerpted a fair bit of research I had been putting off since the morning. After putting away all the laundry at 10, still feeling active, I check. It was Adderall. I can't claim this one either way. By 9 or 10 I had begun to wonder whether it was really Adderall, but I didn't feel confident saying it *was*; my feeling could be fairly described [as 50%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3140).
4. Break; this day/night was for trying [armodafinil](#armodafinil), pill #1
5. Took pill around 6 PM; I had a very long drive to and from an airport ahead of me, ideal for Adderall. In case it was Adderall, I chewed up the pill - by making it absorb faster, more of the effect would be there when I needed it, during driving, and not lingering in my system past midnight. Was it? I didn't notice any change in my pulse, I yawned several times on the way back, my conversation was not more voluminous than usual. I did stay up later than usual, but that's fully explained by walking to get ice cream. All in all, my best guess was that the pill was placebo, and I feel fairly confident but not *hugely* confident that it was placebo. I'd [give it ~70%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3141). And checking the next morning... I was right! Finally.
6. Took pill 12:11 PM. I am not certain. While I do get some things accomplished (a fair amount of work on the Silk Road article and its submission to places), I also have some difficulty reading through a fiction book (_Sum_) and I seem kind of twitchy and constantly shifting windows. I am weakly inclined to think this is Adderall ([say, 60%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3142)). It's not my normal feeling. Next morning - it was Adderall.
7. Week-long break - armodafinil #2 experiment, volunteer work
8. Took pill #6 at 12:35 PM. Hard to be sure. I ultimately decided that it was Adderall because I didn't have as much trouble as I normally would in focusing on reading and then finishing my novel (_Surface Detail_) despite my family watching a movie, though I didn't notice any lack of appetite. Call this one [60-70% Adderall](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3143). I check the next evening and it was Adderall.
9. Took pill at 10:50 AM. At 12:30 I watch the new _Captain America_[^capn], and come out as energetic as I went in and was not hungry for snacks at all during it; at this point, I'm pretty confident ([70%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3144)) that it was Adderall. At 5 I check, and it was. Overall, pretty normal day, save for leading up to the third armodafinil trial.
10. Just 3 Adderall left; took random pill at 12:30. Hopefully I can get a lot of formatting done on [hafu](). I do manage to do a lot of work on it and my appetite seems minor up until 8 PM, although if not for those two observations; [perhaps 60%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3145) that it was Adderall. I check the next morning, and it was *not*.
11. Skipping break day since it was placebo yesterday and I'd like to wind up the Adderall trials. Pill at 12:24 PM. I get very hungry around 3 PM, and it's an unproductive day even considering how much stress and aggravation and the 3 hours a failed Debian unstable upgrade cost me. I feel quite sure ([75%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3146)) it was placebo. It was.
12. Took pill at 11:27 AM. Moderately productive. Not entirely sure. [50% either way](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3147). (It's placebo.)
13. Pill at 12:40 PM. I spend entirely too much time arguing matters related to a [LW post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/72f/why_epidemiology_will_not_correct_itself/) and on IRC, but I manage to channel it into writing a new mini-essay on [my past intellectual sins](Notes#things-i-have-changed-my-mind-about). This sort of thing seems like Adderall behavior, and I don't get hungry until much later. All in all, I feel [easily 75% sure](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3148) it's Adderall; and it was.
14. 12:18 PM. (There are/were just 2 Adderall left now.) I manage to spend almost the entire afternoon single-mindedly concentrating on transcribing two parts of a 1996 Toshio Okada interview (it was very long, and the formatting more challenging than expected), which is strong evidence for Adderall, although I did feel fairly hungry while doing it. I don't go to bed until midnight and & sleep very poorly - despite taking triple my usual melatonin! Inasmuch as I'm already fairly sure that Adderall damages my sleep, this makes me even more confident ([>80%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3149)). When I grumpily crawl out of bed and check: it's Adderall. (One Adderall left.)
15. 10:50 AM. Normal appetite; I try to read through Edward Luttwak's _Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire_, slow going. Overall, I guess it was [placebo with 70%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3150) - I notice nothing I associate with Adderall. I check it at midnight, and it was placebo.
16. 11:30 AM. By 2:30 PM, my hunger is quite strong and I don't feel especially focused - it's difficult to get through the tab-explosion of the morning, although one particularly stupid poster on the DNB ML makes me feel irritated like I might on Adderall. I initially figure the probability at perhaps 60% for Adderall, but when I wake up at 2 AM and am completely unable to get back to sleep, eventually racking up a Zeo score of 73 (compared to the usual 100s), there's no doubt in my mind ([95%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3151)) that the pill was Adderall. And it was the last Adderall pill indeed.

My predictions seem to have been better than random chance, so my default belief - that Adderall does affect me and (mostly) for the better - is borne out. I usually sleep very well and 3 separate incidents of horrible sleep in a few weeks seems rather unlikely (though I didn't keep track of dates carefully enough to link the Zeo data with the Adderall data). Between the price and the sleep disturbances, I don't think Adderall is personally worthwhile.

[^capn]: Much better than I had expected. One of the best superhero movies so far, better than _Thor_ or _Watchmen_ (and especially better than the _Iron Man_ movies). I especially appreciated how it didn't launch right into the usual hackneyed creation of the hero plot-line but made Captain America cool his heels performing & selling war bonds for 10 or 20 minutes. The ending left me a little nonplussed, although I sort of knew it was envisioned as a franchise and I would have to admit that showing Captain America wondering at Times Square is much better an ending than something as cliche as a close-up of his suddenly-opened eyes and then a fade out. (The movie continued the lamentable trend in superhero movies of having a strong female love interest... who only gets the hots for the hero *after* they get muscles or powers. It was particularly bad in _CA_ because she knows him and his heart of gold beforehand! What is the point of a feminist character who is immediately forced to do that?)

# Adrafinil

The [adrafinil](!Wikipedia)/Olmifon (bought simultaneously with the [hydergine](#hydergine) from Anti-Aging Systems, now [Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=32)) was a disappointment. Almost as expensive as actual modafinil, with the risk of liver problems, but did nothing whatsoever that I noticed. It is supposed to be subtler than modafinil, but that's a little ridiculous.

# Aniracetam

Very expensive; I noticed minimal improvements when combined with sulbutiamine & piracetam+choline. Definitely not worthwhile for me.

# Beta-phenylethylamine (PEA)

Based on this [_H+_](http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/neuro/nutraceutical-brain-boosting-free-schwag) article/advertisement, I gave a [PEA](!Wikipedia "Phenethylamine") supplement a try. Noticed nothing. Critical commentators pointed out that PEA was notoriously degraded by the digestive system and has essentially no effect on its own[^phikal], though Neurvana's 'pro' supplement claimed to avoid that. I guess it doesn't.

[^phikal]: For example, [Alexander Shulgin](!Wikipedia)'s famous _[PiHKAL](!Wikipedia)_ book on derivatives of PEA [comments on PEA proper](http://pihkal.info/read.php?domain=pk&id=142) that:

    > - "(with 200, 400, 800 and 1600 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 500 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 800 and 1600 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 25 and 50 mg i.v.) "No effects."
    >
    > ...It is without activity in man! Certainly not for the lack of trying, as some of the dosage trials that are tucked away in the literature (as abstracted in the "Qualitative Comments" given above) are pretty heavy duty. Actually, I truly doubt that all of the experimenters used exactly that phrase, "No effects," but it is patently obvious that no effects were found. It happened to be the phrase I had used in my own notes.
    >
    > ...Phenethylamine is intrinsically a stimulant, although it doesn't last long enough to express this property. In other words, it is rapidly and completely destroyed in the human body. It is only when a number of substituent groups are placed here or there on the molecule that this metabolic fate is avoided and pharmacological activity becomes apparent."

Discussions of PEA mention that it's almost useless without a [MAOI](!Wikipedia "Monoamine oxidase inhibitor") to [pave the way](!Wikipedia "Phenethylamine#Pharmacokinetics"); hence, when I decided to get [deprenyl](#selegiline-deprenyl) and noticed that deprenyl is a MAOI, I decided to also give PEA a second chance in conjunction with deprenyl. Unfortunately, in part due to my own shenanigans, Nubrain canceled the deprenyl order and so I have 20g of PEA sitting around. Well, it'll keep until such time as I *do* get a MAOI.

# Caffeine

I ordered 400g of 'anhydrous [caffeine](!Wikipedia)' ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Caffeine/)) from [Smart Powders](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5261-caffeine-anhydrous-400-grams.aspx). Apparently my [oolong tea](!Wikipedia) doesn't contain very much caffeine, so adding half a gram wakes me up a bit. Surprisingly for something with 'anhydrous' in its name, it doesn't seem to dissolve very well.

Caffeine is of course the most famous stimulant around. But consuming 0.5g or more a day, I have discovered the downside: it is addictive and has a nasty withdrawal - headaches, decreased motivation, apathy, and general unhappiness. (It's a little amusing to read academic descriptions of [caffeine addiction](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/griffiths%20papers/CaffwdReview.2004.pdf)[^bonnetAddiction]; if caffeine were a new drug, I wonder what Schedule it would be in and if people might be even more leery of it than modafinil.) Further, in some ways, caffeine is bad for mental performance, [anecdotally](http://quantifiedself.com/2009/10/the-false-god-of-coffee/) and [scientifically](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/):

[^bonnetAddiction]: ["The Use of Stimulants to Modify Performance During Sleep Loss: A Review by the Sleep Deprivation and Stimulant Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine"](http://www.med.upenn.edu/uep/user_documents/dfd23.pdf), Bonnet et al 2005:

    > "The abuse liability of caffeine has been evaluated.^147,148^ Tolerance development to the subjective effects of caffeine was shown in a study in which caffeine was administered at 300 mg twice each day for 18 days.^148^ Tolerance to the daytime alerting effects of caffeine, as measured by the MSLT, was shown over 2 days on which 250 g of caffeine was given twice each day^48^ and to the sleep-disruptive effects (but not REM percentage) over 7 days of 400 mg of caffeine given 3 times each day.^7^ In humans, placebo-controlled caffeine-discontinuation studies have shown physical dependence on caffeine, as evidenced by a withdrawal syndrome.^147^ The most frequently observed withdrawal symptom is headache, but daytime sleepiness and fatigue are also often reported. The withdrawal-syndrome severity is a function of the dose and duration of prior caffeine use...At higher doses, negative effects such as dysphoria, anxiety, and nervousness are experienced. The subjective-effect profile of caffeine is similar to that of amphetamine,^147^ with the exception that dysphoria/anxiety is more likely to occur with higher caffeine doses than with higher amphetamine doses. Caffeine can be discriminated from placebo by the majority of participants, and correct caffeine identification increases with dose.^147^ Caffeine is self-administered by about 50% of normal subjects who report moderate to heavy caffeine use. In post-hoc analyses of the subjective effects reported by caffeine choosers versus nonchoosers, the choosers report positive effects and the nonchoosers report negative effects. Interestingly, choosers also report negative effects such as headache and fatigue with placebo, and this suggests that caffeine-withdrawal syndrome, secondary to placebo choice, contributes to the likelihood of caffeine self-administration. This implies that physical dependence potentiates behavioral dependence to caffeine."

This research is in considerable contrast to the other substances I like, such as piracetam or fish oil. I knew about withdrawal of course, but it was not so bad when I was drinking only tea. And the side-effects like jitteriness are worse on caffeine without tea; I chalk this up to the lack of [theanine](#theanine). (My later experiences with theanine seems to confirm this.) These negative effects mean that caffeine doesn't satisfy the strictest definition of 'nootropic' (having *no* negative effects), but is merely a 'cognitive enhancer' (with both benefits & costs). One might wonder why I use caffeine anyway if I am so concerned with mental ability. My answer is that this is not a lot of research or very good research (not nearly as good as the research on [nicotine](Nicotine#performance), eg.), and assuming it's true, I don't value [long-term memory](!Wikipedia) that much because LTM is something that is easily assisted or replaced (personal archives, and [spaced repetition]()). For me, my problems tend to be more about _akrasia_ and energy and not getting things done, so even if a stimulant comes with a little cost to long-term memory, it's still useful for me. I'm going continue to use the caffeine. It's not so bad in conjunction with tea, is very cheap, and I'm already addicted, so why not?

I ultimately mixed it in with the 3kg of piracetam and included it in that batch of pills. (I mixed it very thoroughly, one ingredient at a time, so I'm not very worried about 'hot spots'. But if you are, one clever way to get accurate caffeine measurements is to [measure out a large quantity & dissolve it](http://diysupplements.com/add-caffeine-to-everything/) since it's easier to measure water than powder, and dissolving guarantees even distribution. This trick is applicable to anything else that dissolves nicely.)

# Choline

Does little alone, but absolutely necessary in conjunction with [piracetam](#piracetam). In the future, I might try Alpha-GPC instead of the regular cholines; that supposedly has better bio-availability. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Coconut oil

[Coconut oil](!Wikipedia) was recommended by Pontus Granström on the [Dual N-Back mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training) for boosting energy & mental clarity. It is fairly cheap (~$13 for 30 ounces) and tastes surprisingly good; it has a very bad reputation in some parts, but seems to be in the middle of a [rehabilitation](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/dining/02Appe.html). Seth Robert's [Buttermind experiment](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/) found no mental benefits to coconut oil (and benefits to eating butter), but I wonder.

The first night I was eating some coconut oil, I did my n-backing past 11 PM; normally that damages my scores, but instead I got 66/66/75/88/77% (▁▁▂▇▃) on D4B and did not feel mentally exhausted by the end. The next day, I performed well on the [Cambridge](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) mental rotations test. An anecdote, of course, and it may be due to the [vitamin D](#vitamin-d) I simultaneously started. Or another day, I was slumped under apathy after a promising start to the day; a dose of fish & coconut oil, and 1 last vitamin D, and I was back to feeling chipper and optimist. Unfortunately I haven't been testing out coconut oil & vitamin D separately, so who knows which is to thank. But still interesting.

After several weeks of regularly consuming coconut oil and using up the first jar of 15oz, I'm no longer particularly convinced it was doing anything. (I've found it's pretty good for frying eggs, though.) Several days after using up the second jar, I notice no real difference in mood or energy or DNB scores.

# Creatine

[Creatine](!Wikipedia) ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/)) monohydrate was another early essay of mine - cheap (because it's so popular with the bodybuilder types), and with a very good safety record. I bought some from Bulk Powders and combined it with my then-current regimen (piracetam+choline).

I'm not a bodybuilder, but my interest was sparked by [several studies](DNB FAQ#creatine), some showing benefits and others not - usually in subpopulations like vegetarians or old people.

As I am not any of the latter, I didn't *really* expect a mental benefit. As it happens, I observed nothing. What surprised me was something I had forgotten about: its physical benefits. My performance in [Taekwondo](!Wikipedia) classes suddenly improved - specifically, my endurance increased substantially. Before, classes had left me nearly prostrate at the end, but after, I was weary yet fairly alert and happy. (I have done Taekwondo since I was 7, and I have a pretty good sense of what is and is not normal performance for my body. This was not anything as simple as failing to notice increasing fitness or something.) This was driven home to me one day when in a flurry before class, I prepared my customary tea with piracetam, choline & creatine; by the middle of the class, I was feeling faint & tired, had to take a break, and suddenly, thunderstruck, realized that I had absentmindedly forgot to actually drink it! This made me a believer.

After I ran out of creatine, I noticed the increased difficulty, and resolved to buy it again at some point; many months later, there was a sale so bought it in my batch order, $12 for [1000g](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5280-creatine-monohydrate-powder-1000-grams.aspx). As before, it made Taekwondo classes a bit easier. I paid closer attention this second time around and noticed that as one would expect, it only helped with muscular fatigue and did nothing for my aerobic issues.

# Fish oil

[Fish oil](!Wikipedia) ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/)) provides benefits relating to general mood (eg. [inflammation](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110324153712.htm) & [anxiety](http://www.nutrociencia.com.br/upload_files/artigos_download/Kiecolt-Glaser%20et%20al.,%202011.pdf "'Omega-3 supplementation lowers inflammation and anxiety in medical students: a randomized controlled trial' Kiecolt-Glaser et al 2011")^[Psychiatrist [Emily Deans](http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/omega-3-inflammation-and-anxiety-in.html) has an overview of why this study is very nice; she also discusses why fish oil seems like a good idea from an [evolutionary perspective](http://www.psychologytoday.com/print/57150). There was also a weaker [earlier 2005 study](http://www.tohtoritolonen.fi/files/pdf/fontani_2005.pdf) also using healthy young people, which showed reduced anger/anxiety/depression plus slightly faster reactions.]) and [anti](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/is-fish-oil-the-cure-for-schizophrenia-1157380.html)-[schizophrenia](http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/2/146); it is one of the better supplements one can take[^research]. (The known risks are a [higher rate of prostate cancer](http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/04/27/Omega-3-may-up-aggressive-prostate-cancer/UPI-31131303903320/) and internal bleeding, but are outweighed by the known cardiac benefits.) The benefits of omega acids are well-researched. I also noticed what may have been an effect on [my dual n-back scores](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/78e54d222e2c268b/44526d276379dded); the difference is not that obvious (▃▆▃▃▂▂▂▂▄▅▂▄▂▃▅▃▄ vs ▃▄▂▂▃▅▂▂▄▁▄▃▅▂▃▂▄▂▁▇▃▂▂▄▄▃▃▂▃▂▂▂▃▄▄▃▆▄▄▂▃▄▃▁▂▂▂▃▂▄▂▁▁▂▄▁▃▂▄) and appears mostly in the averages - Toomim's quick two-sample [t-test](!Wikipedia) gave there being a difference only 77%.

[^research]: it is at the top of the [supplement snake oil](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/) list thanks to tons of correlations eg. ["Teenage Boys Who Eat Fish At Least Once A Week Achieve Higher Intelligence Scores"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309092957.htm), anti-inflammatory properties (see ["Fish Oil: What the Prescriber Needs to Know"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526555/) on arthritis), and others - ["Fish oil can head off first psychotic episodes"](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2010/02/fish-oil-can-head-off-first-psychotic-episodes.html) ([study](http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/2/146); [Seth Roberts commentary](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/03/schizophrenia-prevented-by-fish-oil/)), ["Fish Oil May Fight Breast Cancer"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/61005/title/Fish_oil_may_fight_breast_cancer), ["Fatty Fish May Cut Prostate Cancer Risk"](http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20090324/fatty-fish-may-cut-prostate-cancer-risk) & ["Walnuts slow prostate cancer"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/57701/title/Science_%2B_the_Public__Walnuts_slow_prostate_cancer_growth), ["Benefits of omega-3 fatty acids tally up"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/55362/title/Benefits_of_omega-3_fatty_acids_tally_up), ["Serum Phospholipid Docosahexaenonic Acid Is Associated with Cognitive Functioning during Middle Adulthood"](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/02/24/jn.109.119578.abstract) [endless](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/) [anecdotes](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/07/todays-happines.html).

    But like any other supplement, there are some [safety](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/health/24real.html) [concerns](http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2010/03/major-fish-oil-products-face-prop-65-suit.aspx) negative studies like ["Fish oil fails to hold off heart arrhythmia "](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/65600/title/Fish_oil_fails_to_hold_off_heart_arrhythmia) or ["other reports cast doubt on a protective effect against dementia"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/67709/title/2010_Science_News_of_the_Year_Nutrition) or ["Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn't Make Babies Smart"](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html) ([WSJ](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303550904575562053166893846.html)) (an [early](http://fn.bmj.com/content/early/2006/12/21/adc.2006.099085.short "Cognitive assessment at 2½ years following fish oil supplementation in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial") [promise](http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/111/1/e39.full "Maternal Supplementation With Very-Long-Chain n-3 Fatty Acids During Pregnancy and Lactation Augments Children’s IQ at 4 Years of Age") but one that [faded](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/122/2/e472.short "Effect of Supplementing Pregnant and Lactating Mothers With n-3 Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids on Children's IQ and Body Mass Index at 7 Years of Age") [a](http://www.ajcn.org/content/83/6/1337.short  "Effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation of women with low-risk pregnancies on pregnancy outcomes and growth measures at birth: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials") [bit](http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2003/03000/A_Randomized_Trial_of_Docosahexaenoic_Acid.11.aspx "A Randomized Trial of Docosahexaenoic Acid Supplementation During the Third Trimester of Pregnancy") [later](http://rnd.edpsciences.org/index.php?option=com_article&access=standard&Itemid=129&url=/articles/rnd/pdf/2005/05/r5502.pdf "Maternal fish oil supplementation in lactation: effect on developmental outcome in breast-fed infants")) or ["...Supplementation with DHA compared with placebo did not slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease."](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/304/17/1903.abstract).

The price is not as good as multivitamins or melatonin. The studies showing effects generally use pretty high dosages, 1-4g daily. I took 4 capsules a day for roughly 4g of omega acids. The jar of 400 is 100 days' worth, and costs ~$17, or around 17¢ a day. The general health benefits push me over the edge of favoring its indefinite use, but looking to economize.

Straight liquid is the obvious answer; and unsurprisingly, liquid is more cost-effective than pills (but like with the powders, straight fish oil isn't very appetizing) in lieu of membership somewhere or some other price-break. I bought 4 bottles (16 fluid ounces each) for [$53.31](http://www.iherb.com/Nature-s-Answer-Liquid-Omega-3-Deep-Sea-Fish-Oil-EPA-DHA-Natural-Orange-Flavor-16-fl-oz-480-ml/7908) total (thanks to coupons & sales), and each bottle lasts around a month and a half for perhaps half a year, or ~$100 for a year's supply. (As it turned out, the 4 bottles lasted from 4 December 2010 to 17 June 2011, or 195 days.) My next batch lasted 19 August 2011-20 February 2012, and cost $58.27. Since I needed to buy empty 00 capsules (for my [lithium experiment](#lithium-experiment)) and a book (Stanovich 2010, for SIAI work) from Amazon, I bought 4 more bottles of 16fl oz Nature's Answer (lemon-lime) at $48.44, which I began using 27 February 2012.

<!--
The obvious thing to test fish oil for is mood, like lithium. The other benefits like anti-schizophrenia are too hard to test. The medical student trial (Kiecolt-Glaser et al 2011) did not see changes until visit 3, after 3 weeks of supplementation. (Visit 1, 3 weeks, visit 2, supplementation started for 3 weeks, visit 3, supplementation continued 3 weeks, visit 4 etc.) There were no tests in between the test starting week 1 and starting week 3, so I can't pin it down any further. This suggests randomizing in 3 week blocks.

The placebos can be the usual pills filled with olive oil. The Nature's Answer fish oil is lemon-flavored; it may be worth mixing in some lemon juice. Anxiety was measured via the Beck Anxiety scale; the placebo mean was 1.2 on a stddev of 0.075, and the experimental mean was 0.93 on a stddev of 0.076. (These are all log-transformed covariates or something; I don't know what that means, but if I naively plug those numbers into Cohen's d, I get a very large effect: $\frac{1.2 - 0.93}{0.076} = 3.55$.)

This suggests I could get away with running only a couple pairs of blocks.

# Huperzine-A

My [experience report](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/6e35c60f904c2417):

One for the 'null hypothesis' files - Huperzine-A did nothing for me. Unlike piracetam or fish oil, after a full bottle^[[Source Naturals](http://www.amazon.com/Huperzine-A-200mcg-120-tabs/dp/B000WJH2HI/), 120 pills at 200mcg each], I noticed no side-effects, no mental improvements of any kind, and no changes in DNB scores from straight Huperzine-A.

Possible confounding factors:

- youth: I am considerably younger than the other poster who uses HA
- I only tested a few days with choline+H-A (but I didn't notice anything beyond the choline there).
- counterfeiting? Source Naturals is supposed to be trustworthy, but rare herbal products are most susceptible to fake goods.

It's really too bad. H-A is cheap, compact, doesn't taste at all, and in general is much easier to take than fish oil (and *much* easier to swallow than piracetam or choline!). But if it doesn't deliver, it doesn't deliver.

# Hydergine

[Hydergine](!Wikipedia) was another disappointment (like the [adrafinil](#adrafinil), purchased from Anti-Aging Systems/[Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=29)). I noticed little to nothing that couldn't be normal daily variation.

# Kratom

<!-- TODO: ping Maxwell when done -->

[Kratom](!Wikipedia) ([Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/plants/kratom/kratom.shtml), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/)) is a tree leaf from Southeast Asia; it's addictive to some degree (like [caffeine](#caffeine) and [nicotine](#nicotine)), and so it is regulated/banned in Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Bhutan [among others](!Wikipedia "Kratom#Regulations") - but not the USA. (One might think that kratom's common use there indicates how very addictive it must be, except it literally grows on trees so it can't be too hard to get.) Kratom is not particularly well-studied (and what has been studied is not necessarily relevant - I'm not addicted to any opiates!), and it suffers the usual herbal problem of being an endlessly variable food product and not a specific chemical with the fun risks of perhaps being poisonous, but in my reading it doesn't seem to be *particularly* dangerous or have serious side-effects.

A LessWronger found that it worked well for him as far as motivation and getting things done went, as did another LessWronger who sells it online (["a reasonable productivity enhancer"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2du/a_rational_education/26qu)) as did one of his customers, a [pickup artist](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2vf/in_which_i_fantasize_about_drugs/2sgl) oddly enough. The former was curious whether it would work for me too and sent me Speciosa Pro's ["Starter Pack: Test Drive"](http://www.speciosapro.com/product_info.php/cPath/30/products_id/76) (a sampler of 14 packets of powder and a cute little wooden spoon). In SE Asia, they're apparently normally chewed, but the powders are brewed as a tea.

1. I started with the 10g of 'Vitality Enhanced Blend', a sort of tan dust. Used 2 little-spoonfuls (dust tastes a fair bit like green/oolong tea dust) into the tea mug and then some boiling water. A minute of steeping and... bleh. Tastes sort of musty and sour. (I see why people recommended sweetening it with honey.) The effects? While I might've been more motivated - I hadn't had caffeine that day and was a tad under the weather, a feeling which seemed to go away perhaps half an hour after starting - I can't say I experienced any nausea or very noticeable effects. (At least the flavor is no longer quite so offensive.)
2. 3 days later, I'm fairly miserable (slept poorly, had a hair-raising incident, and a big project was not received as well as I had hoped), so well before dinner (and after a nap) I brew up 2 wooden-spoons of 'Malaysia Green' (olive-color dust). I drank it down; tasted slightly better than the first. I was feeling better after the nap, and the kratom didn't seem to change that.
3. The next day was somewhat similar, so at 2:40 I tried out 3 spoonfuls of 'sm00th' (?), a straight tan powder. Like the Malaysia Green, not so bad tasting. By the second cup, my stomach is growling a little. No particular motivation.
4. A week later: 'Golden Sumatran', 3 spoonfuls, a more yellowish powder. (I combined it with some tea dregs to hopefully cut the flavor a bit.) Had a paper to review that night. No (subjectively noticeable) effect on energy or productivity. I tried 4 spoonfuls at noon the next day; nothing except a little mental tension, for lack of a better word. I think that was just the harbinger of what my runny nose that day and the day before was, a head cold that laid me low during the evening.
5. 4 spoons of 'Thai Red Vein' at 1:30 PM; cold hasn't gone away but the acetaminophen was making it bearable.
6. 4 spoons of 'Enriched Thai' (brown) at 8PM. Steeped 15 minutes, drank; no effect - I have to take a break to watch 3 _Mobile Suit Gundam_ episodes before I even feel like working.
7. 5 spoons of 'Enriched Sumatran' (tannish-brown) at 3:10 PM; especially sludgy this time, the Sumatran powder must be finer than the other.

# Lion's Mane mushroom

_[Hericium erinaceus](!Wikipedia)_ was recommended strongly by several on the [ImmInst.org](http://www.imminst.org/forum/) forums for its long-term benefits to learning, apparently linked to [Nerve growth factor](!Wikipedia). Highly speculative stuff, and it's unclear whether the mushroom powder I bought was the right form to take (ImmInst.org discussions seem to universally assume one is taking an alcohol or hotwater extract). It tasted nice, though, and I mixed it into my sleeping pills (which contain melatonin & tryptophan). I'll probably never know whether the $30 for 0.5lb was well-spent or not.

(I was more than a little nonplussed when the mushroom seller included a little pamphlet educating one about how papaya leaves can cure cancer, and how I'm shortening my life by decades by not eating many raw fruits & vegetables. There were some studies cited, but usually for points disconnected from any actual curing or longevity-inducing results. I also noticed that the author was a woman; which struck terror into my heart. What is it with women and alternative medicine? Women are greater consumers of alternative medicine according to [one survey](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad343.pdf) (by as much as 18%), just as they are greater consumers of medicine in general (in the 25-44 ages, [ratio 2.26](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/namcs_summary/namcssum2008.pdf "National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2008 Summary Tables")!); and my subjective impressions has been formed by things like watching my chiropractor uncle go through a few hours of almost exclusively female patients. One wonders what is at play there. The perceived masculinity of modern medicine and men's general fear of biological issues? Perhaps a man goes to the doctor and does whatever surgery he is told; a woman gossips with her friends and listens to old wives' tales? If so, a lot of that could be explained as [social signaling](http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf) or social grooming. "Try this small inconvenient thing I told you! There, now our bonds are a little stronger.")

# Lithium

[Lithium](!Wikipedia) ([review](http://www.jacn.org/content/21/1/14.full "'Lithium: Occurrence, Dietary Intakes, Nutritional Essentiality', Schrauzer 2002")) is a pretty unusual substance and like caffeine and the amphetamines, questionably classified as a nootropic. As a metal, lithium is obviously dangerous at many doses. It's famously used for manic-depression and some other disorders, but the doses are large and verge on the point where 'the cure is worse than the disease'. Most lithium research focuses on these larger doses, so one has to parse citations carefully to see whether it is telling one something useful about the low levels one might use for supplements or just reinforcing what one already knew ('large doses are double-edged swords').

So, on the positive side:

- _Discover_'s ["The Metal Marvel That Has Mended Brains for 50 Years"](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/the-brain-2/27-metal-marvel-mended-brains-50-years-lithium/) covers some of the neurogenesis effects of lithium (see also [Shiotsuki 2008](http://www.gjpsy.uni-goettingen.de/gjp-article-shiotsuki.pdf "Drinking Spring Water and Lithium Absorption: A Preliminary Study"))
- lithium has a connection to [DHA](!Wikipedia "Docosahexaenoic acid") and thus fish oil: ["How lithium works in the brain"](http://machineslikeus.com/news/how-lithium-works-brain)
- in mice, lithium [helps prevent](http://neurosciencenews.com/lithium-prevents-brain-damage-parkinsons-disease/) Parkinson's

    There has been [speculation](/docs/2008-yeh.pdf "Lithium may be useful in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in individuals at risk of presenile familial Alzheimer's disease") [about](http://www.vrp.com/stress/lithiums-potential-role-in-preventing-alzheimers-disease-mineral-benefits-other-conditions-besides-bipolar-disorder "Lithium's Potential Role in Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease") anti-Alzheimer's properties due to [correlations](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/359.full "'Lithium and risk for Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients with bipolar disorder', Nunes et al 2007"), but an experimental null result in [Hampel et al 2009](http://forschungsreferat.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/gerontopsychiatrie/pdf/2009_Hampel_Lithium_trial_in_AD.pdf "Lithium Trial in Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomized, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter 10-Week Study").

    The results on [dementia](!Wikipedia) are also mixed: [Terao et al 2006](/docs/2006-terao.pdf "Lithium and dementia: A preliminary study") found patients prescribed lithium had less, while [Dunn et al 2005](/docs/2005-dunn.pdf "Does Lithium Therapy Protect Against the Onset of Dementia?") had found the exact opposite.
- ["Lithium and cognitive enhancement: leave it or take it?"](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/publications/download.php?id=11205), Tsaltas et al 2008, is a review of lithium studies. There may be some long-term benefits related to the neuroprotective effects[^lithium-long-term], which counterbalance the negative or null effects discussed.

[^lithium-long-term]: From Tsaltas 2008, pg 15:

    > "Tentative conclusions from studies in normal subjects are that acute lithium does not affect short-term memory; subchronic administration spares basic short-term memory of ongoing events but higher task demands (as in neuropsychological testing) occasionally reveal mild deficits. As do learning deficits, these too appear transient. A similar picture emerges with respect to lithium effects on human long-term recall. In animal studies, subchronic and chronic lithium with clinically relevant serum levels does not affect spatial reference or object recognition memory and actually enhances working memory under certain conditions. This is consistent with recent clinical MRI findings noting improved immediate verbal memory after a 4-year period of lithium treatment, along with MRI evidence of increased hippocampal volume over the same period.
    >
    > Human attention is quite consistently reported normal under lithium. Some older animal studies report narrowing of attention onto high-salience cues and compromised latent inhibition, but these results are challenged by more recent data indicating normal function. Finally, information on lithium effects on executive functions is sparse and cannot be evaluated at present. More basic research is definitely needed with respect to lithium effects on attention and executive functions. Recent reports on lithium effects on the cognitive-behavioral deficits induced by various challenges to the nervous system in animal models are quite promising. Lithium protects against neuroanatomical and neurochemical effects and also moderates cognitive deficits induced by stress or CNS trauma such as irradiation or anoxia. In some cases, such deficits are not simply prevented but appear to be reversed post facto. This combined neuroprotective- and cognitive-enhancing action of lithium is noted primarily with respect to hippocampally related spatial memory tasks. It appears to involve protection against the reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptotic rate noted mainly in the hippocampus under these challenges...
    >
    > A similar picture emerges in relation to lithium effects on the cognitive compromises induced by neurodegenerative disorders. Lithium reduces the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in bipolar patients, and there is evidence suggesting that this is associated with reduced GSK-3beta expression. Evidence of lithium’s moderating action on hippocampally related cognitive deficits also comes from transgenic animal models of Alzheimer’s disease...In cognitive dysfunction associated with psychiatric conditions, beneficial effects of lithium have emerged on the neuroanatomical level from imaging studies. Lithium treatment of bipolar patients has been associated with hippocampal volume increase and appears to entail concomitant cognitive improvements. These neuroimaging findings are not limited to bipolar patients, but involve people at ultrahigh risk of developing a psychotic disorder where lithium appears to arrest neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes associated with the onset of psychosis.
    >
    > In conclusion, increasing neuroanatomical and neurochemical evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies supports that lithium has neuroprotective properties, mainly involving hippocampal cells (Moore et al. 2000; Manji et al. 2001; Sassi et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2004; Chuang 2004; Chuang and Priller 2006)."

On the null and negative sides:

- although the lithium-Parkinson's research with its relatively low doses is a reminder to avoid lithium doses anywhere near what is used for psychiatric disorders: ["In at least two known cases, toxic levels of the drug have actually caused Parkinson's."](http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_18361882)
- In [one small human trial](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/abs/nbt.1837.html) (149 experimental, 447 total selected from >1000) on [PatientsLikeMe](!Wikipedia) investigating [a 2008 paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/6/2052.full)'s finding that lithium might delay ALS, only the null effect was found.
- There are serious negative effects to taking a lot of lithium - [2-4 grams will trash](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) your long-term memory and similar doses have been linked with [many cognitive issues](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=lithium+cognition).
- Tsaltas et al 2008 says many studies can't be generalized to healthy populations; for every study finding damage to performance or memory, there seems to be a study finding the null result. But whichever is true, it is not encouraging[^lithium-bad].
- Of 22 Alzheimer's patients taking 100mg of lithium carbonate, 3 stopped due to side-effects ([Macdonald 2008 et al](/docs/2008-macdonald.pdf "A feasibility and tolerability study of lithium in Alzheimer's disease")); but 100mg carbonate is substantially more than 5mg orotate, and one might guess that old ill people would report more side-effects in general

[^lithium-bad]: Tsaltas et al 2008, pg 15:

    > "The effects of lithium on learning in clinical populations appear to be mildly detrimental, possibly attributable to lithium’s generalized dampening effect on performance. They appear most pronounced in the initial stages of lithium administration, as corroborated by animal studies. Therefore, results produced by subchronic regimes should be treated cautiously, as perhaps reflecting general influences on arousal and mood."

[Lithium orotate](!Wikipedia) is sold commercially in low-doses; I purchased 200 pills with 5mg of lithium each. To put this dosage in comparison, the [therapeutic](!Wikipedia "Lithium pharmacology") doses of lithium are roughly 100x higher (around 500mg). The pills are small and tasteless, and not at all hard to take.

Some suggested that the lithium would turn me into a 'zombie', recalling the complaints of psychiatric patients. But at 5mg for 200 pills, I'd have to eat half the jar to get up to a single clinical dose, so I'm not worried about overdosing. To test this, I took on day 1 & 2 no less than 4 pills or 20mg as a 'attack dose'; I didn't notice any significant change in emotional affect or energy levels. And it may've helped my motivation (though I am also trying out the tyrosine).

The effect? 3 or 4 weeks later, I'm not sure. When I began putting all of my nootropic powders into pill-form, I put half a lithium pill in each, and nevertheless ran out of lithium fairly quickly (3kg of piracetam makes for >4000 OO-size pills); those capsules were buried at the bottom of the bucket under lithium-less pills. So I suddenly went cold-turkey on lithium. Reflecting on the past 2 weeks, I *seem* to have been less optimistic and productive, with items now lingering on my To-Do list which I didn't expect to. An effect? Possibly.

## Lithium experiment

Most of the reported benefits of lithium are impossible for me to test: rates of suicide and Parkinson's are obviously right out, but so is crime and neurogenesis (the former is too rare & unusual, the latter too subtle & hard to measure), and likewise potential negatives. So we could measure:

1. mood, via daily self-report ; should increase
2. long-term memory (Mnemosyne 2.0's statistics); could increase (neurogenesis), do nothing (null result), or decrease (metal poisoning)
3. working memory (dual n-back scores via Brain Workshop^[This metric is a little troubling since working memory is trainable and that's the point of dual n-back - but my own scores have been stagnant for a long time and the blocking should reduce the impact of any very slow linear growth in scores.]); like long-term memory
4. sleep (Zeo); should increase (via mood improvement)
5. time procrastinating on computer ([arbtt](http://darcs.nomeata.de/arbtt/doc/users_guide/) daemon every 10 seconds records open & active windows; these statistics can be parsed into categories like work or play. Total time on latter categories could be a useful metric. A second metric would be number of commits to the `gwern.net` source repository.)

Lithium is persistent in the body, and its effects are not acute especially in low doses; this calls for long blocked trials. 30 days is reasonable and corresponds to the time-spans in some experiments. With subtle effects, we need a lot of data, so we want at least half a year (6 blocks) or better yet, a year (12 blocks); this requires 180 actives and 180 placebos. This is easily covered by [$11](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B6X66U/) for 200x5mg lithium orotate and [$14](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-GELATIN-CAPSULES--BOVINE/dp/B002R3JJ8W/) for 1000x1g empty capsules. For convenience I settled on 168 lithium, 168 placebos, (7 pill-machine batches, 14 batches total); I can use them in 24 paired blocks of 7 days/1 week each (48 total blocks/48 weeks). The lithium expiration date is October 2014, so this should be more than safe.

The methodology would be essentially the same as the [vitamin D in the morning](Zeo#l#vitamin-d-at-morn-helps) experiment: put a multiple of 7 placebos in one container, the same number of actives in another identical container, hide & randomly pick one of them, use container for X days then the other for X days, look inside them for the label to determine which period was active and which was placebo, refill them, and start again.

The principal metric would be 'mood', however defined. Zeo's web interface & data export includes a field for 'Day Feel', which is a rating 1-5 of general mood & quality of day. I could record this at the end of the day. 1-5 might be a little crude even with a year of data, so a more sophisticated measure might be in order. The first mood study is paywalled so I'm not sure what they used, but Shiotsuki 2008 used [State-Trait of Anxiety Inventory](!Wikipedia) (STAI) and [Profiles of Mood States](!Wikipedia) Test (POMS). The [full POMS](http://www.cyberpediatria.com/profile_moodStates.pdf) sounds too long to use daily, but the ['Brief POMS'](/docs/1987-cella.pdf "A brief POMS measure of distress for cancer patients") might work: items are ranked 0-4 and it's just a few items drawn from the full POMS:

18. Blue
32. Discouraged
14. Sad
50. Bewildered
36. Miserable
44. Gloomy
49. Weary
16. On Edge
37. Muddled
26. Uneasy
5. Unhappy

In the original 1987 paper 'A brief POMS measure of distress for cancer patients', patients answering this questionnaire had a mean total mean of 10.43 (standard deviation 8.87). Is this the best way to measure mood? I've asked Seth Roberts.

# Melatonin

See [Melatonin]() for information on effects & cost; I regularly use melatonin to sleep, and investigating with my Zeo, it [does seem](Zeo#melatonin) to improve & shorten my sleep.

# Modafinil

See [Modafinil]() for background on performance improvements and side-effects; the following sections are about my usage.

## SpierX

Here are the notes I jotted down while trying out modafinil back in November 2009. I didn't make any effort to write sensibly, so this makes my lucidity seem much worse than it actually was:

Thursday: 3g piracetam/4g choline bitartrate at 1; 1 200mg modafinil at 2:20; noticed a 'leveling' of fatigue by 3:30; dry eyes? no bad after taste or anything. a little light-headed by 4:30, but mentally clear and focused. wonder if light-headedness is due simply to missing lunch and not modafinil. 5:43: noticed my foot jiggling - doesn't usually jiggle while in piracetam/choline. 7:30: starting feeling a bit jittery & manic - not much or to a problematic level but definitely noticeable; but then, that often happens when I miss lunch & dinner. 12:30: bedtime. Can't sleep even with 3mg of melatonin! Subjectively, I toss & turn (in part thanks to my cat) until 4:30, when I really wake up. I hang around bed for another hour & then give up & get up. After a shower, I feel fairly normal, strangely, though not as good as if I had truly slept 8 hours. The lesson here is to pay attention to wikipedia when it says the half-life is 12-15 hours! About 6AM I take 200mg; all the way up to 2pm I feel increasingly less energetic and unfocused, though when I do apply myself I think as well as ever. Not fixed by food or tea or piracetam/choline. I want to be up until midnight, so I take half a pill of 100mg and chew it (since I'm not planning on staying up all night and I want it to work relatively soon). From 4-12PM, I notice that today as well my heart rate is elevated; I measure it a few times and it seems to average to ~70BPM, which is higher than normal, but not high enough to concern me. I stay up to midnight fine, take 3mg of melatonin at 12:30, and have no trouble sleeping; I think I fall asleep around 1. Alarm goes off at 6, I get up at 7:15 and take the other 100mg. Only 100mg/half-a-pill because I don't want to leave the half laying around in the open, and I'm curious whether 100mg + ~5 hours of sleep will be enough after the last 2 days. Maybe next weekend I'll just go without sleep entirely to see what my limits are.

In general, I feel a little bit less alert, but still close to normal. By 6PM, I have a mild headache, but I try out 30 rounds of gbrainy (haven't played it in months) and am surprised to find that I reach an all-time high; no idea whether this is due to DNB or not, since Gbrainy is very heavily 'crystallized' (half the challenge disappears as you learn how the problems work), but it does indicate I'm not deluding myself about mental ability. (To give a figure: my last score well before I did any DNB was 64, and I was doing well that day; on modafinil, I had a 77.) I figure the headache might be food related, eat, and by 7:30 the headache is pretty much gone and I'm fine up to midnight.

I took 1.5mg of melatonin, and went to bed at ~1:30AM; I woke up around 6:30, took a modafinil pill/200mg, and felt pretty reasonable. By noon my mind started to feel a bit fuzzy, and lunch didn't make much of it go away. I've been looking at studies, and users seem to degrade after 30 hours; I started on mid-Thursday, so call that 10 hours, then 24 (Friday), 24 (Saturday), and 14 (Sunday), totaling 72hrs with <20hrs sleep; this might be equivalent to 52hrs with no sleep, and [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Modafinil") writes:

> One study of helicopter pilots suggested that 600 mg of modafinil given in three doses can be used to keep pilots alert and maintain their accuracy at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep.[60] However, significant levels of nausea and vertigo were observed. Another study of fighter pilots showed that modafinil given in three divided 100 mg doses sustained the flight control accuracy of sleep-deprived F-117 pilots to within about 27 percent of baseline levels for 37 hours, without any considerable side effects.[61] In an 88-hour sleep loss study of simulated military grounds operations, 400 mg/day doses were mildly helpful at maintaining alertness and performance of subjects compared to placebo, but the researchers concluded that this dose was not high enough to compensate for most of the effects of complete sleep loss.

If I stop tonight and do nothing Monday (and I sleep the normal eight hours and do not pay any penalty), then that'll be 4 out of 5 days on modafinil, each saving 3 or 4 hours. Each day took one pill which cost me $1.20, but each pill saved let's call it 3.5 hours; if I value my time at minimum wage, or 7.25/hr (federal minimum wage), then that 3.5 hours is worth $25.37, which is much more than $1.20, ~21x more.

My mental performance continues as before; curiously, I get an even higher score on Gbrainy, despite being sure I was less sharp than yesterday. Either I'm wrong about that, or Gbrainy is even more trainable than I thought. I go to bed Sunday around 1AM, and get up around 8AM (so call it 6 or 7 hours).

Monday: It's a long day ahead of me, so I take 200mg. Reasonable performance.

Tuesday: I went to bed at 1am, and first woke up at 6am, and I wrote down a dream; the lucid dreaming book I was reading advised that waking up in the morning and then going back for a short nap often causes lucid dreams, so I tried that - and wound up waking up at 10am with no dreams at all. Oops. I take a pill, but the whole day I don't feel so hot, although my conversation and arguments seem as cogent as ever. I'm also having a terrible time focusing on any actual work. At 8 I take another; I'm behind on too many things, and it looks like I need an all-nighter to catch up. The dose is no good; at 11, I still feel like at 8, possibly worse, and I take another along with the choline+piracetam (which makes a total of 600mg for the day). Come 12:30, and I disconsolately note that I don't seem any better, although I still seem to understand the IQ essays I am reading. I wonder if this is tolerance to modafinil, or perhaps sleep catching up to me? Possibly it's just that I don't remember what the quasi-light-headedness of modafinil felt like. I feel this sort of zombie-like state without change to 4am, so it must be doing something, when I give up and go to bed, getting up at 7:30 without too much trouble. Some N-backing at 9am gives me some low scores but also some pretty high scores (38/43/66/40/24/67/60/71/54 or ▂▂▆▂▁▆▅▇▄), which suggests I can perform normally if I concentrate. I take another pill and am fine the rest of the day, going to bed at 1am as usual.

Thursday: this is an important day where I really need to be awake. I'm up around 8, take a pill, and save one for later; I'll take half a pill at noon and the other half at 2. This works very well, and I don't feel tired well up to midnight, even though I spent an hour walking.

Friday: alarm clock woke me at 7:40, but I somehow managed to go back to sleep until 9:40. Perhaps sleep inertia is building up despite the modafinil. Another pill. I am in general noticing less effect, but I'll not take any this weekend to see whether I have simply gotten used to it.

Sat/Sun: bed at 1/2AM, awake at 10/11 respectively. Generally unmotivated.

Mon: went to bed at 11:30 Sun, woke at 7:30 and dozed to 8. 200mg at 8:30. No particular effect. Past this, I stop keeping notes. The main significant thing I notice is that my throat seems to be a little rough and my voice hoarser than usual.

(On a side note, I think I understand now why modafinil doesn't lead to a _[Beggars in Spain](!Wikipedia)_ scenario; BiS includes massive IQ and motivation boosts as part of the Sleepless modification. Just adding 8 hours a day doesn't do the world-changing trick, no more than some researchers living to 90 and others to 60 has lead to the former taking over. If everyone were suddenly granted the ability to never need sleep, many of them would have no idea what to do with the extra 8 or 9 hours and might well be destroyed by the gift; it takes a lot of motivation to make good use of the time, and if one cannot, then it is a curse akin to the stories of immortals who yearn for death - they yearn because life is not a blessing to them, though that is a fact more about them than life.)

## Modalert

In 2011, as part of the Silk Road research, I ordered 10x100mg Modalert (5btc) from a seller. I also asked him about his sourcing, since if it was bad, it'd be valuable to me to know whether it was sourced from one of the vendors listed [in my table](Modafinil#suppliers-prices). He replied, more or less, "I get them from a large Far Eastern pharmaceuticals wholesaler. I think they're probably the supplier for a number of the online pharmacies." 100mg seems likely to be too low, so I treated this shipment as 5 doses:

1. I split the 2 pills into 4 doses for each hour from midnight to 4 AM. 3D driver issues in Debian unstable prevented me from using Brain Workshop, so I don't have any DNB scores to compare with the armodafinil DNB scores. I had the subjective impression that I was worse off with the Modalert, although I still managed to get a fair bit done so the deficits couldn't've been *too* bad. The apathy during the morning felt worse than armodafinil, but that could have been caused by or exacerbated by an unexpected and very stressful 2 hour drive through rush hour and multiple accidents; the quick hour-long nap at 10 AM was half-waking half-light-sleep according to the Zeo, but seemed to help a bit. As before, I began to feel better in the afternoon and by evening felt normal, doing my usual reading. That night, the Zeo recorded my sleep as lasting ~9:40, when it was usually more like 8:40-9:00 (although I am not sure that this was due to the modafinil inasmuch as once a week or so I tend to sleep in that long, as I did a few days later without any influence from the modafinil); assuming the worse, the nap and extra sleep cost me 2 hours for a net profit of ~7 hours. While it's not clear how modafinil affects recovery sleep (see the footnote in the [essay](Modafinil#effects)), it's still interesting to ponder the benefits of merely being able to delay sleep[^totalSleep].
2. I tried taking whole pills at 1 and 3 AM. I felt kind of bushed at 9 AM after all the reading, and the 50 minute nap didn't help much - I was sleep only around 10 minutes and spent most of it thinking or meditation. Just as well the 3D driver is still broken; I doubt the scores would be reasonable. Began to perk up again past 10 AM, then felt more bushed at 1 PM, and so on throughout the day; kind of gave up and began watching & finishing anime (_[Amagami](!Wikipedia)_ and _[Voices of a Distant Star](!Wikipedia)_) for the rest of the day with occasional reading breaks (eg. to start Scott's _Seeing Like A State_, which is [as described](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/) so far). As expected from the low quality of the day, the recovery sleep was bigger than before: a full 10 hours rather than 9:40; the next day, I slept a normal 8:50, and the following day ~8:20 (woken up early); 10:20 (slept in); 8:44; 8:18 (▁▇▁▁). It will be interesting to see whether my excess sleep remains in the hour range for 'good' modafinil nights and two hours for 'bad' modafinil nights.
3. I decided to try out day-time usage on 2 consecutive days, taking the 100mg at noon or 1 PM. On both days, I thought I did feel more energetic but nothing extraordinary (maybe not even as strong as the nicotine), and I had trouble falling asleep on Halloween, thinking about the meta-ethics essay I had been writing diligently on both days. Not a good use compared to staying up a night.

[^totalSleep]: This calculation - reaping only $\frac{7}{9}$ of the naive expectation - gives one pause. In [another article](Melatonin#health-performance), I point to a mice study that sleep deficits can take 28 days to repay. What if the gain from modafinil is entirely wiped out by repayment and all it did was defer sleep? Would that render modafinil a waste of money? Perhaps. Thinking on it, I believe deferring sleep is of *some* value, but I cannot decide whether it is a net profit.

    That it is somewhat valuable is clear if we consider it under another guise. Imagine you received the same salary you do, but paid every day. Accounting systems would incur considerable costs handling daily payments, since they would be making so many more and so much smaller payments, and they would have to know instantly whether you showed up to work that day and all sorts of other details, and the recipients themselves would waste time dealing with all these checks or looking through all the deposits to their account, and any errors would be that much harder to track down. (And conversely, expensive 'payday loans' are strong evidence that for poor people, a bi-weekly payment is much too infrequent.) One might draw a comparison to batching or buffers in computers: by letting data pile up in buffers, the computer can then deal with them in one batch, amortizing overhead over many items rather than incurring the overhead again and again. The downside, of course, is that latency will suffer and performance may drop based on that or the items becoming outdated & useless. The right trade-off will depend on the specifics; one would not expect random buffer-sizes to be optimal, but one would have to test and see what works best.

    Similarly, we could try applying Nick Bostrom's [reversal test](http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf) and ask ourselves, how would we react to a virus which had no effect but to eliminate sleep from alternating nights and double sleep in the intervening nights? We would probably grouch about it for a while and then adapt to our new hedonistic lifestyle of partying or working hard. On the other hand, imagine the virus had the effect of eliminating normal sleep but instead, every 2 minutes, a person would fall asleep for a minute. This would be disastrous! Besides the most immediate problems like safely driving vehicles, how would anything get done? You would hold a meeting and at any point, a third of the participants would be asleep. If the virus made it instead 2 hours on, one hour off, that would be better but still problematic: there would be constant interruptions. And so on, until we reach our present state of 16 hours on, 8 hours off. Given that we rejected all the earlier buffer sizes, one wonders if 16:8 can be defended as uniquely suited to circumstances. Is that *optimal*? It may be, given the synchronization with the night-day cycle, but I wonder; rush hour alone stands as an argument against synchronized sleep - wouldn't our infrastructure would be much cheaper if it only had to handle the average daily load rather than cope with the projected peak loads? Might not a longer cycle be better? The longer the day, the less we are interrupted by sleep; it's a hoary cliche about programmers that they prefer to work in long sustained marathons during long nights rather than sprint occasionally during a distraction-filled day, to the point where some famously adopt a 28 hour day (which evenly divides a week into 6 days). Are there other occupations which would benefit from a 20 hour waking period? Or 24 hour waking period? We might not know because without chemical assistance, circadian rhythms would overpower anyone attempting such schedules. It certainly would be nice if one had long time chunks in which could read a challenging book in one sitting, without heroic arrangements.

Most people I talk to about modafinil seem to use it for daytime usage; for me that has not ever worked out well, but I had nothing in particular to show against it. So, as I was capping the last of my piracetam-caffeine mix and clearing off my desk, I put the 4 remaining Modalerts pills into capsules with the last of my creatine powder and then mixed them with 4 of the theanine-creatine pills. Like the previous [Adderall trial](#adderall-blind-testing), I will pick one pill blindly each day and guess at the end which it was. If it was active (modafinil-creatine), take a break the next day; if placebo (theanine-creatine), replace the placebo and try again the next day. We'll see if I notice anything on DNB or possibly `gwern.net` edits.

1. Take at 10 AM; seem a bit more active but that could just be the pressure of the holiday season combined with my nice clean desk. I do the chores without too much issue and make progress on other things, but nothing major; I survive going to _The Sitter_ without too much tiredness, so ultimately I decide to give the palm to it being active, but only with [60%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4790) confidence. I check the next day, and it was placebo. Oops.
2. Take at 11 AM; distractions ensue and the Christmas tree-cutting also takes up much of the day. By 7 PM, I am exhausted and in a bad mood. While I don't expect day-time modafinil to buoy me up, I do expect it to at least buffer me against being tired, and so I conclude placebo this time, and with more confidence than yesterday ([65%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4805)). I check before bed, and it was placebo.
3. 10:30 AM; no major effect that I notice throughout the day - it's neither good nor bad. This smells like placebo (and part of my mind is going 'how unlikely is it to get placebo 3 times in a row!', which is just the [Gambler's fallacy](!Wikipedia) talking inasmuch as this is sampling *with* replacement). I give it [60%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4857) placebo; I check the next day right before taking, and it is. Man!
4. 1 PM; overall this was a pretty productive day, but I can't say it was *very* productive. I would almost say even odds, but for some reason I feel a little more inclined towards modafinil. Say 55%. That night's sleep was vile: the Zeo says it took me 40 minutes to fall asleep, I only slept 7:37 total, and I woke up 7 times. I'm comfortable taking this as evidence of modafinil (half-life 10 hours, 1 PM to midnight is only 1 full halving), bumping my prediction to [75%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4880). I check, and sure enough - modafinil.
5. 10:40 AM; again no major effects, although I got two jQuery extensions working and some additional writing so one could argue the day went well. I don't know; [50%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4913). Placebo.
6. 11 AM; a rather productive day. I give it [65%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4923). To my surprise, it was placebo.
7. 10 AM; this was an especially productive day, but this was also the day my [nicotine gum](#nicotine-gum) finally arrived and I just *had* to try it (I had been waiting so long); it's definitely a stimulant, alright. But this trashes my own [subjective estimates](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4954); I hoped it was just placebo, but no, it was modafinil.
8. 9:50 AM; nothing noticed by noon. Managed to finish ["Reasons of State: Why Didn't Denmark Sell Greenland?"](Notes#reasons-of-state-why-didnt-denmark-sell-greenland) which was a surprising amount of work, especially after I managed to delete a third of the first draft - but nothing I would chalk up to modafinil. I decide to give it [60%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/4989) placebo, and I turn out to be wrong: it was my last modafinil.

So with these 8 results in hand, what do I think? Roughly, I was right 5 of the days and wrong 3 of them. If not for the sleep effect on #4, which is - in a way - cheating (one hopes to detect modafinil due to *good* effects), the ratio would be 5:4 which is awfully close to a coin-flip (and also roughly in line with my expressed confidences - yay calibration!).

I can't call this much of a success; there may be an effect on my productivity but it's certainly not very clear subjectively. I'll chalk this up as a failure for modafinil and evidence for what I believed - day-time modafinil use does not work for me (even if it works for others).

## Armodafinil

[Armodafinil](!Wikipedia) is sort of a purified modafinil which Cephalon sells under the brand-name 'Nuvigil' (and Sun under 'Waklert'^[I don't understand how Sun can produce any armodafinil, as the armodafinil patents are recent enough that the modafinil loophole shouldn't apply.]). Armodafinil acts much the same way (see the [ADS Drug Profile](/docs/2009-garnockjones.pdf)) but the modafinil variant filtered out are the [faster-acting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12657914) [molecules](http://www.genemedrx.com/ArmodafinilR.pptx)[^pptx]. Hence, it is supposed to last longer. as studies like ["Pharmacodynamic effects on alertness of single doses of armodafinil in healthy subjects during a nocturnal period of acute sleep loss"](/docs/2006-dinges.pdf) ([abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16393442)) seem to bear out; anecdotally, it's also more powerful, with Cephalon offering pills with doses as low as 50mg. (To be technical, modafinil is [racemic](!Wikipedia): it comes in two [forms](!Wikipedia "Isomer") which are rotations, mirror-images of each other. The rotation usually doesn't matter, but [sometimes](!Wikipedia "Enantiomer#Examples") it matters *tremendously* - for example, one form of [thalidomide](!Wikipedia "Thalidomide#Teratogenic mechanism") stops [morning sickness](!Wikipedia), and the other rotation causes [hideous birth defects](!Wikipedia "Thalidomide#Birth defects").)

Besides [Adderall](#adderall), I also purchased on [Silk Road]() 5x250mg pills of armodafinil. The price was extremely reasonable, 1.5btc or roughly $23 at that day's exchange rate; I attribute the low price to the seller being new and needing feedback, and offering a discount to induce buyers to take a risk on him. (Buyers bear a significant risk on Silk Road since sellers can easily physically anonymize themselves from their shipment, but intrinsically a buyer can be found just by following the package.) Because of the longer active-time, I resolved to test the armodafinil not during the day, but with an all-nighter.

### Nuvigil

1. First use

    Took full pill at 10:21 PM when I started feeling a bit tired. Around 11:30, I noticed my head feeling fuzzy but my reading seemed to still be up to snuff. I would eventually finish the science book around 9 AM the next day, taking some very long breaks to walk the dog, write some poems, write a program, do Mnemosyne review (memory performance: subjectively below average, but not as bad as I would have expected from staying up all night), and some other things. Around 4 AM, I reflected that I felt much as I had during my nightwatch job at the same hour of the day - except I had switched sleep schedules for the job. The tiredness continued to build and my willpower weakened so the morning wasn't as productive as it could have been - but my actual performance when I could be bothered was still pretty normal. That struck me as kind of interesting that I can *feel* very tired and not *act* tired, in line with the anecdotes.

    Past noon, I began to feel better, but since I would be driving to errands around 4 PM, I decided to not risk it and take an hour-long nap, which went well, as did the driving. The evening was normal enough that I forgot I had stayed up the previous night, and indeed, I didn't much feel like going to bed until past midnight. I then slept well, the [Zeo]() giving me a 108 ZQ (not an all-time record, but still unusual).
2. I had intended to run another Adderall trial this day but then I learned we would be going to the midnight showing of the last [_Harry Potter_](!Wikipedia "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2") movie. A perfect opportunity: going to bed at 3 AM after a stimulating battle movie would mean crappy sleep, so why not just do another armodafinil trial and kill 2 birds with one stone?

    I took the pill at 11 PM the evening of (technically, the day before); that day was a little low on sleep than usual, since I had woken up an hour or half-hour early. I didn't yawn at all during the movie (merely mediocre to my eyes with some questionable parts)[^potter]. It worked much the same as it did the previous time - as I walked around at 5 AM or so, I felt perfectly alert. I made good use of the hours and wrote up my memories of [ICON 2011]().

    (As I was doing this, I reflected how modafinil is such a pure example of the money-time tradeoff. It's not that you pay someone else to do something for you, which necessarily they will do in a way different from you; nor is it that you have exchanged money to free yourself of a burden of some future time-investment; nor have you paid money for a speculative return of time later in life like with many medical expenses or supplements. Rather, you have paid for 8 hours *today* of your own time.)

    And as before, around 9 AM I began to feel the peculiar feeling that I was mentally able and apathetic (in a sort of _[aboulia](!Wikipedia)_ way); so I decided to try what helped last time, a short nap. But this time, though I took a full hour, I slept not a wink and my Zeo recorded only 2 transient episodes of light sleep! A back-handed sort of proof of alertness, I suppose. I didn't bother trying again. The rest of the day was mediocre, and I wound up spending much of it on chores and whatnot out of my control. Mentally, I felt better past 3 PM.

    This continued up to 1 AM, at which point I decided not to take a second armodafinil (why spend a second pill to gain what would likely be an unproductive set of 8 hours?) and finish up the experiment with some n-backing. My 5 rounds: 60/38/62/44/50[^settings]. This was surprising. Compare those scores with scores from several previous days: 39/42/44/40/20/28/36. I had estimated before the n-backing that my scores would be in the low-end of my usual performance (20-30%) since I had not slept for the past 41 hours, and instead, the *lowest* score was 38%. If one did not know the context, one might think I had discovered a good nootropic! Interesting evidence that armodafinil preserves at least one kind of mental performance.
3. I stayed up late writing some [poems](/fiction/Genshiken) and about how [Folding@home kills](Charity is not about helping), and decided to make a night of it. I took the armodafinil at 1 AM; the interesting bit is that this was the morning/evening after what turned out to be an Adderall (as opposed to placebo) trial, so perhaps I will see how well or ill they go together. A set of normal scores from a previous day was 32%/43%/51%/48%. At 11 PM, I scored 39% on DNB; at 1 AM, I scored 50%/43%; 5:15 AM, 39%/37%; 4:10 PM, 42%/40%; 11 PM, 55%/21%/38%. (▂▄▆▅ vs ▃▅▄▃▃▄▃▇▁▃)

    The peculiar tired-sharp feeling was there as usual, and the DNB scores continue to suggest this is not an illusion, as they remain in the same 30-50% band as my normal performance. I did not notice the previous '_aboulia_' feeling; instead, around noon, I was filled with a nervous energy and a disturbingly rapid pulse which meditation & deep breathing did little to help with, and which didn't go away for an hour or so. Fortunately, this was primarily at church, so while I felt irritable, I didn't actually interact with anyone or snap at them, and was able to keep a lid on it. I have no idea what that was about. I wondered if it might've been a [serotonin storm](!Wikipedia) since amphetamines are some of the drugs that can trigger storms but the Adderall had been at 10:50 AM the previous day, or >25 hours (the half-lives of the ingredients being around 13 hours). An hour or two previously I had taken my usual caffeine-piracetam pill with my morning tea - could that have interacted with the armodafinil and the residual Adderall? Or was it [caffeine+modafinil](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/kejkc/nootropics_that_dont_workbad_stacks/c2jq83e)? Speculation, perhaps. A house-mate was ill for a few hours the previous day, so maybe the truth is as prosaic as me catching whatever he had.
4. Stayed up with the purpose of finishing my work for a [contest](http://lesswrong.com/lw/69p/prize_new_contest_for_spaced_repetition/). This time, instead of taking the pill as a single large dose (I feel that after 3 times, I understand what it's like), I will take 4 doses over the new day. I took the first quarter at 1 AM, when I was starting to feel a little foggy but not significantly impaired. Second dose, 5:30 AM; feeling a little impaired. 8:20 AM, third dose; as usual, I feel physically a bit off and mentally tired - but still mentally sharp when I actually do something. Early on, my heart rate seemed a bit high and my limbs trembling, but it's pretty clear now that that was the caffeine or piracetam. It may be that the other day, it was the caffeine's fault as I suspected. The final dose was around noon. The afternoon 'crash' wasn't so pronounced this time, although motivation remains a problem. I put everything into finishing up the [spaced repetition literature review](Spaced repetition#literature-review), and didn't do any n-backing until 11:30 PM: 32/34/31/54/40%.
4. With the last pill, I wound up trying split-doses on non-full nights; that is, if one full pill keeps me awake one full night, what does 1/4th the pill do?

    1. Between midnight and 1:36 AM, I do four rounds of n-back: 50/39/30/55%. I then take 1/4th of the pill and have some tea. At roughly 1:30 AM, AngryParsley linked a SF anthology/novel, [_Fine Structure_](http://qntm.org/structure), which sucked me in for the next 3-4 hours until I finally finished the whole thing. At 5:20 AM, circumstances forced me to go to bed, still having only taken 1/4th of the pill and that determines this particular experiment of sleep; I quickly do some n-back: 29/20/20/54/42. I fall asleep in 13 minutes and sleep for 2:48, for a ZQ of 28 (a full night being ~100). I did not notice anything from that possible modafinil+caffeine interaction. Subjectively upon awakening: I don't feel *great*, but I don't feel like 2-3 hours of sleep either. N-back at 10 AM after breakfast: 25/54/44/38/33. These are not very impressive, but seem normal despite taking the last armodafinil ~9 hours ago; perhaps the 3 hours *were* enough. Later that day, at 11:30 PM (just before bed): 26/56/47.
    2. 2 break days later, I took the quarter-pill at 11:22 PM. I had discovered I had for years physically possessed a very long interview not available online, and transcribing that seemed like a good way to use up a few hours. I did some reading, some Mnemosyne, and started it around midnight, finishing around 2:30 AM. There seemed a mental dip around 30 minutes after the armodafinil, but then things really picked up and I made very good progress transcribing the final draft of 9000 words in that period. (In comparison, "The Conscience of the Otaking" parts 2 & 4 were much easier to read than the tiny font of the _RahXephon_ booklet, took perhaps 3 hours, and totaled only 6500 words. The nicotine is probably also to thank.) By 3:40 AM, my writing seems to be clumsier and my mind fogged. Began DNB at 3:50: 61/53/44. Went to bed at 4:05, fell asleep in 16 minutes, slept for 3:56. Waking up was easier and I felt better, so the extra hour seemed to help.
    3. With this experiment, I broke from the previous methodology, taking the remaining and final half Nuvigil at midnight. I am behind on work and could use a full night to catch up. By 8 AM, I am as usual impressed by the Nuvigil - with Modalert or something, I generally start to feel down by mid-morning, but with Nuvigil, I feel pretty much as I did at 1 AM. Sleep: 9:51/9:15/8:27

[^potter]: Specifically, the film is completely unintelligible if you had not read the book. The best I can say for it is that it delivers the action and events one expects in the right order and with basic competence, but its artistic merits are few. It seems generally devoid of the imagination and visual flights of fancy that animated movies 1 and 3 especially (although [Mike Darwin disagrees](http://chronopause.com/index.php/2011/07/15/902/)), copping out on standard imagery like a _Star Wars_-style force field over Hogwarts Castle, or luminescent white fog when Harry was dead and in his head; I was deeply disappointed to not see any sights that struck me as novel and new. (For example, the aforementioned dead scene could have been done in so many interesting ways, like why not show Harry & Dumbledore in a bustling King's Cross shot in bright sharp detail, but with not a single person in sight and all the luggage and equipment animatedly moving purposefully on their own?) The ending in particular boggles me. I actually turned to the person next to me and asked them whether that really was the climax and Voldemort was dead, his death was so little dwelt upon or laden with significance (despite a musical score that beat you over the head about *everything else*). In the book, I remember it feeling like a climactic scene, with everyone watching and little speeches explaining why Voldemort was about to be defeated, and a suitable victory celebration; I read in the paper the next day a quote from the director or screenwriter who said one scene was cut because Voldemort would not talk but simply try to efficiently kill Harry. (This is presumably the explanation for the incredible *anti*-climax. Hopefully.) I was dumbfounded by the depths of dishonesty or delusion or disregard: Voldemort not only does that in _Deathly Hallows_ multiple times, he does it *every time* he deals with Harry, exactly as the classic villains (he is numbered among) always do! How was it possible for this man to read the books many times, as he must have, and still say such a thing?

### Waklert

I noticed on SR something I had never seen before, an offer for 150mgx10 of "Waklert" for ฿13.47 (then, ฿1 = $3.14). I searched and it seemed Sun was somehow manufacturing armodafinil! Interesting. Maybe not cost-effective, but I tried out of curiosity. They look and are packaged the same as the Modalert, but at a higher price-point: 150 rather than 81 rupees. Not entirely sure how to use them: assuming quality is the same, 150mg Waklert is still 100mg less armodafinil than the 250mg Nuvigil pills.

1. Take quarter at midnight, another quarter at 2 AM. Night runs reasonably well once I remember to eat a lot of food (I finish a big editing task I had put off for weeks), but the apathy kicks in early around 4 AM so I gave up and watched _[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World](!Wikipedia)_, finishing around 6 AM. I then read until it's time to go to a big shotgun club function, which occupies the rest of the morning and afternoon; I had nothing to do much of the time and napped very poorly on occasion. By the time we got back at 4 PM, the apathy was completely gone and I started some modafinil research with gusto (interrupted by going to see _Puss in Boots_). That night: Zeo recorded 8:30 of sleep, gap of about 1:50 in the recording, figure 10:10 total sleep; following night, 8:33; third night, 8:47; fourth, 8:20 (▇▁▁▁).
2. First quarter at 1:20 AM. Second quarter at 4 AM. 20 minute nap at 7:30 AM; took show and last 2 doses at 11 AM. (If I feel bad past 3 PM, I'll try one of the Modalerts or maybe another quarter of a Waklert - 150mg may just be too little.) Overall, pretty good day. Nights: 9:43; 9:51; 7:57; 8:25; 8:08; 9:02; 8:07 (▇█▁▂▁▄▁).
3. First half at 6 AM; second half at noon. Wrote [a short essay](Notes#the-morality-of-sperm-donation) I'd been putting off and napped for 1:40 from 9 AM to 10:40. This approach seems to work a little better as far as the _aboulia_ goes. (I also bother to smell my urine this time around - there's a definite off smell to it.) Nights: 10:02; 8:50; 10:40; 7:38 (2 bad nights of nasal infections); 8:28; 8:20; 8:43 (▆▃█▁▂▂▃).
4. Whole pill at 5:42 AM. (Somewhat productive night/morning beforehand.) DNB at 2 PM: 52/36/54 (▇▁█); slept for 49 minutes; DNB at 8 PM: 50/44/38/40 (▆▄▁▂). Nights: 10:02; 8:02; no data; 9:21; 8:20 (█▁ ▅▂).
5. Whole pill at 3 AM. I spend the entire morning and afternoon typing up a transcript of ["Earth in My Window"](/docs/2005-murakami "from 'Little Boy'"). I tried taking a nap around 10 AM, but during the hour I was down, I had <5m of light sleep, the Zeo said. After I finished the transcript (~16,600 words with formatting), I was completely pooped and watched a bunch of _Mobile Suit Gundam_ episodes, then I did [Mnemosyne](Spaced repetition). The rest of the night was nothing to write home about either - some reading, movie watching, etc. Next time I will go back to split-doses and avoid typing up 110kB of text. On the positive side, this is the first trial I had available the 'average daily grade' Mnemosyne 2.0 plugin. The daily averages all are 3-point-something (peaking at 3.89 and flooring at 3.59), so just graphing the past 2 weeks, the modafinil day, and recovery days: ▅█▅▆▄▆▄▃▅▄▁▄▄ ▁ ▂▄▄█. Not an impressive performance but there was a previous non-modafinil day just as bad, and I'm not too sure how important a metric this is; I must see whether future trials show similar underperformance. Nights: 11:29; 9:22; 8:25; 8:41.

# Nicotine

Following up on my little [investigation into performance & health benefits](Nicotine) of [nicotine](!Wikipedia), I ordered the most cost-effective batch of chewing gum I could find on Amazon (100 Nicorette 4mg); and the seller canceled on me! Poor show, Direct Super center, very poor show.

In August 2011, after winning the [spaced repetition contest](http://lesswrong.com/lw/76h/spaced_repetition_literature_review_prize_and_the/) and finishing up the [Adderall double-blind testing](#adderall-blind-testing), I decided the time was right to try nicotine again. I had since learned that e-cigarettes use nicotine dissolved in water, and that nicotine-water was a vastly cheaper source of nicotine than either gum or patches. So I ordered [250ml of water at 12mg/ml](http://www.nicvape.com/store/p/28-250-ml-of-12-mg-ml.aspx) (total cost: $18.20). A cigarette apparently delivers around 1mg of nicotine, so half a ml would be a solid dose of nicotine, making that ~500 doses. Plenty to experiment with. The question is, besides the stimulant effect, nicotine also causes 'habit formation'; what habits should I reinforce with nicotine? Exercise, n-backing, and spaced repetition seem like 2 good targets.

## Nicotine water

It arrived as described, a little bottle around the volume of a soda can. I had handy a plastic syringe with milliliter units which I used to measure out the nicotine-water into my tea. I began with half a ml the first day, 1ml the second day, and 2ml the third day. (My [Zeo]() sleep scores were 85/103/86 (▁▇▁), and the latter had a feline explanation; these values are within normal variation for me, so if nicotine affects my sleep, it does so to a lesser extent than Adderall.) Subjectively, it's hard to describe. At half a ml, I didn't really notice anything; at 1 and 2ml, I thought I began to notice it - sort of a cleaner caffeine. It's nice so far. It's not as strong as I expected. I looked into whether the boiling water might be breaking it down, but the answer seems to be no - boiling tobacco is a standard way to extract nicotine, actually, and nicotine's own boiling point is much higher than water; nor do I notice a drastic difference when I take it in ordinary water. And according to various e-cigarette sources, the liquid should be good for at least a year.

2ml is supposed to translate to 24mg, which is a big dose. I do not believe any of the commercial patches go much past that. I asked Wedrifid, whose notes inspired my initial interest, and he was taking perhaps 2-4mg, and expressed astonishment that I might be taking 24mg. (2mg is in line with what I am told by another person - that 2mg was so much that they actually felt a little sick. On the other hand, in one study, the subjects could not reliably distinguish between 1mg and placebo[^kumari].) 24mg is particularly troubling in that I weigh ~68kg, and [nicotine poisoning](!Wikipedia) and the nicotine LD50 start, for me, at around 68mg of nicotine. The upper end of the range, 10mg/kg or 680mg for me, is calculated based on experienced smokers. Something is wrong here - I can't see why I would have nicotine tolerance comparable to a hardened smoker, inasmuch as my maximum prior exposure was second-hand smoke. More likely is that either the syringe is misleading me or the seller NicVape sold me something more dilute than 12mg/ml. (I am sure that it's not simply plain water; when I mix the drops with regular water, I can feel the [propylene glycol](!Wikipedia) burning as it goes down.) I would rather not accuse an established and apparently well-liked supplier of fraud, nor would I like to simply shrug and say I have a mysterious tolerance and must experiment with doses closer to the LD50, so the most likely problem is a problem with the syringe. The next day I altered the procedure to sucking up 8ml, squirting out enough fluid to move the meniscus down to 7ml, and then ejecting the rest back into the container. The result was another mild clean stimulation comparable to the previous 1ml days. The obvious next step is to try a completely different measuring device, which doesn't change either.

[^kumari]: ["Cognitive effects of nicotine in humans: an fMRI study"](http://www.cognitiongroup.com/publication/Cognitive_Effects_of_Nicotine_fMRI_published.pdf), Kumari et al 2003

    > "...Four subjects correctly stated when they received nicotine, five subjects were unsure, and the remaining two stated incorrectly which treatment they received on each occasion of testing. These numbers are sufficiently close to chance expectation that even the four subjects whose statements corresponded to the treatments received may have been guessing."

One item always of interest to me is sleep; a stimulant is no good if it damages my sleep (unless that's what it is *supposed* to do, like modafinil) - [anecdotes](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=56793) [and](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16782142) [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16829553) suggest that it does. Over the past few days, my Zeo sleep scores continued to look normal. But that was while not taking nicotine much later than 5 PM. In lieu of a different ml measurer to test my theory that my syringe is misleading me, I decide to more directly test nicotine's effect on sleep by taking 2ml at 10:30 PM, and go to bed at 12:20; I get a decent ZQ of 94 and I fall asleep in 16 minutes, a bit below my weekly average of 19 minutes. The next day, I take 1ml directly before going to sleep at 12:20; the ZQ is 95 and time to sleep is 14 minutes.

The next cheap proposition to test is that the 2ml dose is so large that the sedation/depressive effect of nicotine has begun to kick in. This is easy to test: take much less, like half a ml. I do so two or three times over the next day, and subjectively the feeling seems to be the same - which seems to support that proposition (although perhaps I've been placebo effecting myself this whole time, in which case the exact amount doesn't matter). If this theory is true, my previous sleep results don't show anything; one would expect nicotine-as-sedative to not hurt sleep or improve it. I skip the day (no cravings or addiction noticed), and take half a ml right before bed at 11:30; I fall asleep in 12 minutes and have a ZQ of ~105. The next few days I try putting one or two drops into the tea kettle, which seems to work as well (or poorly) as before. At that point, I was warned that there were some results that nicotine withdrawal can kick in with delays as long as a week, so I shouldn't be confident that a few days off proved an absence of addiction; I immediately quit to see what the week would bring. 4 or 7 days in, I didn't notice anything. I'm still using it, but I'm definitely a little nonplussed and disgruntled - I need some independent source of nicotine to compare with!

After trying the nicotine gum (see below) and experiencing effects, I decided the liquid was busted somehow and to request a refund. To its credit, NicVape immediately agreed to a refund.

## Nicotine gum

So I eventually got around to ordering another thing of nicotine gum, ["Habitrol Nicotine Gum, 4mg MINT flavor COATED gum. 96 pieces per box "](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD7P1E/). Gum should be easier to double-blind myself with than nicotine patches - just buy some mint gum. If 4mg is too much, cut the gum in half or whatever. When it arrived, my hopes were borne out: the gum was rectangular and soft, which made it easy to cut into fourths.

Remembering what Wedrifid told me, I decided to start with a quarter of a piece (~1mg). The gum was pretty tasteless, which ought to make blinding easier. The effects were noticeable around 10 minutes - greater energy verging on jitteriness, much faster typing, and apparent general quickening of thought. Like a more pleasant caffeine. While testing my typing speed in [Amphetype](https://code.google.com/p/amphetype/), my speed seemed to go up >=5 WPM, even after the time penalties for correcting the increased mistakes; I also did twice the usual number without feeling especially tired. A second dose was similar, and the third dose was at 10 PM before playing _[Ninja Gaiden II](!Wikipedia)_ seemed to stop the usual exhaustion I feel after playing through a level or so. (It's a tough game, which I have yet to master like _[Ninja Gaiden Black](!Wikipedia)_.) Returning to the previous concern about sleep problems, though I went to bed at 11:45 PM, it still took 28 minutes to fall sleep (compared to my more usual 10-20 minute range); the next day I use 2mg from 7-8PM while driving, going to bed at midnight, where my sleep latency is a more reasonable 14 minutes. I then skipped for 3 days to see whether any cravings would pop up (they didn't). I subsequently used 1mg every few days for driving or _Ninja Gaiden II_, and while there were no cravings or other side-effects, the stimulation definitely seemed to get weaker - benefits seemed to still exist, but I could no longer describe any considerable energy or jitteriness. May try using 2mg next.

The easiest way to use 2mg was to use half a gum; I tried not chewing it but just holding it in my cheek. The first night I tried, this seemed to work well for motivation; I knocked off a few long-standing to-do items. Subsequently, I began using it for writing, where it has been similarly useful.

# Oxiracetam

[Oxiracetam](!Wikipedia) is one of the 3 most popular -racetams; less popular than piracetam but seems to be more popular than aniracetam. Prices have come down significantly since the early 2000s, and stand at around [1.2g/$](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5342-oxiracetam-powder.aspx) or roughly 50 cents a dose, which was low enough to experiment with; key question, does it stack with piracetam or is it redundant for me? (Oxiracetam can't compete on price with my piracetam pile stockpile.)

I bought 60 grams from Smart Powders (as usual) and combined it with the DMAE; I couldn't compare oxiracetam+DMAE vs oxiracetam+choline-bitartrate because I had capped all the choline with the piracetam. One immediate advantage of oxiracetam: it is not unbelievably foul tasting like piracetam, but slightly sweet.

Regardless, while in the absence of piracetam, I did notice some stimulant effects (somewhat negative - more aggressive than usual while driving) and similar effects to piracetam, I did *not* notice any mental performance beyond piracetam when using them both. The most I can say is that on some nights, I seemed to be less easily tired when writing or editing or n-backing (and I felt less tired than [ICON 2011]() than [ICON 2010]()), but those were also often nights I was *also* trying out all the other things I had gotten in that order from Smart Powders, and I am still dis-entangling what was responsible. (Probably the [l-theanine](#theanine) or [sulbutiamine](#sulbutiamine).)

In other words, for me, the two -racetams did not seem to 'stack'. The following are a number of n-back scores from before (piracetam only) and after (piracetam and oxiracetam):

1. [28,39,26,48,34]; [34,60]; [37,53,55] (▁▂▁▄▁▁▆▂▄▅▆)
2. [56,66,44,46,30,24,50,56,34,39,34]; [30,50,31,37,41,23]; [53,35,40] (▅▇▃▃▁▁▄▅▁▂▁▁▄▁▂▂▁▄▁▂)

There may be some improvement hidden in there, but nothing obvious. Oxiracetam has smaller recommended doses than piracetam, true, but even after taking that into account, oxiracetam is still more expensive per dose. When I finished it off, I decided it hadn't shown any benefits so there was no point in continuing it.

# Piracetam

So as you may remember, I bought 500g of [piracetam](!Wikipedia) ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Piracetam/)) from Smart Powders (piracetam is one of the cheapest nootropics and SP one of the cheapest suppliers; the others are [much more expensive](http://users4.jabry.com/isochroma/Racetam%20Prices.htm)), and I've tried it out for several days (started on 7 September 2009, and used it steadily up to mid-December). I've varied my dose from 3 grams to 12 grams (at least, I think the little scoop measures in grams), taking them in my tea or bitter fruit juice. Cranberry worked the best, although orange juice masks the taste pretty well; I also accidentally learned that piracetam stings horribly when I got some on a cat scratch. 3 grams (alone) didn't seem to do much of anything while 12 grams gave me a nasty headache. I also ate 2 or 3 eggs a day.

Subjectively, I didn't notice drastic changes. Here's what I did notice:

- My thinking seems a little clearer
- I'm not so easy to tire - I went through a month's worth of my Wikipedia watchlist with less fatigue than usual, and n-backing doesn't seem so tiring.
- [DNB](DNB FAQ)-wise, eyeballing my stats file seems to indicate a small increase: when I compare peak scores D4B scores, I see mostly 50s and a few 60s before piracetam, and after starting piracetam, a few 70s mixed into the 50s and 60s. Natural increase from training? Dunno - I've been stuck on D4B since June, so 5 or 10% in a week or 3 seems a little suspicious. A graph of the score series[^raw-scores]:

- The other day, I also noticed I was fidgeting less
- After a week or two, I *think* I noticed better reflexes - both in catching falling cups and the [saccading](!Wikipedia "Saccade") in BW seems slightly easier. But I could be imagining this since I just saw an Erowid report mentioning better reflexes & I may've read that one before I started. (Darn those subconscious impressions and memories! :)

After 7 days, I ordered a kg of [choline](!Wikipedia) bitartrate from <http://www.bulkpowders.com>. Choline is standard among piracetam-users because it is pretty universally supported by anecdotes about "piracetam headaches", has strong support in [rat/mice experiments](/docs/1981-bartus.pdf)^[That study is also interesting for finding benefits to chronic piracetam+choline supplementation in the mice, which seems connected to a [Russian study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095391) which found that piracetam (among other more obscure nootropics) increased secretion of [BDNF](!Wikipedia "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor") in mice. See also [Drug heuristics](Drug heuristics#piracetam) on a study involving choline supplementation in pregnant rats.], and also some [human-related research](!Wikipedia "Piracetam#Side effects"). So I figured I couldn't fairly test piracetam without some regular choline - the eggs might not be enough, might be the wrong kind, etc. It has a quite distinctly fishy smell, but the actual taste is more citrus-y, and it seems to neutralize the piracetam taste in tea (which makes things much easier for me).

The first day (22 September) I took ~10g since I was taking 5g of piracetam; I wound up with some diarrhea & farting. Oops.

On the plus side:
- I noticed the less-fatigue thing to a greater extent, getting out of my classes much less tired than usual. (Caveat: my sleep schedule recently changed for the saner recently, so it's possible that's responsible. I think it's more the piracetam+choline, though.)
- One thing I wasn't expecting was a decrease in my appetite - nobody had mentioned that in their reports.I don't like being bothered by my appetite (I know how to eat fine without it reminding me), so I count this as a plus.
- Fidgeting was reduced further

The second day I went with ~6g of choline; much less intestinal distress, but similar effects vis-a-vis fidgeting, loss of appetite, & reduced fatigue. So in general I thought this was a positive experience, but I'm not sure it was worth $40 for ~2 months' worth, and it was tedious consuming it dissolved.

Fortunately for me, the FDA decided Smart Powder's advertising was too explicit and ordered its piracetam sales stopped; I was equivocal at the previous price point, but then I saw that between the bulk discount and the fire-sale coupon, 3kg was only $99.99 (shipping was amortized over that, the choline, caffeine, and tryptophan). So I ordered in September 2010. As well, I had decided to cap my own pills, eliminating the inconvenience and bad taste. 3kg goes a very long way so I am nowhere close to running out of my pills; there is nothing to report since, as the pills are simply part of my daily routine.

# Selegiline / Deprenyl

[Selegiline](!Wikipedia) (also known as Deprenyl) is a somewhat popular ([Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Selegeline.shtml), [r/nootropics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/search?q=selegiline+OR+deprenyl&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance)) stimulant/anti-depressant which affects dopamine.

Dosage is apparently 5-10mg a day, so presumably that's ~60 days. (Prices can be better elsewhere; selegiline is popular for treating dogs with senile dementia, where those 60x5mg will cost [$_2_](http://www.petcarerx.com/pcrx/ProductPages/Product.aspx?pid=10983) rather than $35[^economics]. One needs a veterinarian's prescription to purchase from pet-oriented online pharmacies, though.) I ordered it & modafinil from [Nubrain.com](http://www.nubrain.com/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=12) at \$35 for 60x5mg; Nubrain delayed and eventually canceled my order - and my enthusiasm. Between that and realizing how much of a premium I was paying for Nubrain's deprenyl, I'm tabling deprenyl along with nicotine & modafinil for now. Which is too bad, because I had even ordered 20g of [PEA](#beta-phenylethylamine-pea) from Smart Powders to try out with the deprenyl. (My later attempt to order some off the Silk Road also failed when the seller canceled the order.)

[^economics]: One might expect some sort of catch - surely there's a massive quality difference to go with the massive price difference? But there could well not be; I would not be surprised to learn that the dog selegiline and the human selegiline came out of the same vat.

    It's basic economics: the price of a good must be greater than cost of producing said good, but only under [perfect competition](!Wikipedia) will price = cost. Otherwise, the price is simply whatever maximizes profit for the seller. (Bottled water doesn't *really* cost $2 to produce.) This can lead to apparently counter-intuitive consequences involving [price discrimination](!Wikipedia) & [market segmentation](!Wikipedia) - such as ['damaged' goods](!Wikipedia "Damaged good#Computer hardware") which are the premium product which has been deliberately degraded and sold for less (some [Intel](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/18/intel-wants-to-charge-50-to-unlock-stuff-your-cpu-can-already-d/) CPUs, some [headphones](http://mikebeauchamp.com/misc/sennheiser-hd-555-to-hd-595-mod/) etc.). The most famous examples were railroads; one notable passage by French engineer-economist Jules Dupuit describes the motivation for the conditions in 1849:

    > "It is not because of the few thousand francs which would have to be spent to put a roof [!] over the third-class carriages or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches. What the company is trying to do is to prevent the passengers who can pay the second class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich. And it is again for the same reason that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing with first-class passengers. Having refused the poor what is necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous."

    Price discrimination is aided by barriers such as oligopolies, which there clearly is in the case of using veterinary drugs on humans - any doctor to do so would probably be guilty of medical malpractice or similar charges. Similarly, we can predict that whenever there is a veterinary drug which is chemically identical to a human drug, the veterinary drug will be much cheaper than the human drug because pet owners do not value their pets more than themselves. Human drugs are ostensibly held to a higher standard than veterinary drugs; so if veterinary prices are *higher*, then there will be an arbitrage incentive to simply buy the cheaper human version and 'downgrade' them to veterinary drugs.

    As with any thesis, there are exceptions to this general practice. For example, [theanine](#theanine) for dogs is sold under the brand Anxitane is sold at almost a dollar a pill, and apparently a month's supply costs [$50+ vs $13 for human-branded theanine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/f4skp/ltheanine_a_natural_nutraceutical_my_vet_just/); on the other hand, this thesis predicts 'downgrading' if the market priced pet versions higher than human versions, and that Reddit poster appears to be doing just that with her dog.

# Sulbutiamine

[2 experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/an862/whos_had_experience_with_sulbutiamine/) with [sulbutiamine](!Wikipedia) on Reddit.

My general impression is positive; it does seem to help with endurance and extended the effect of piracetam+choline, but is not as effective as that combo. At $20 for 30g (bought from Smart Powders), I'm not sure it's worthwhile, but I think at $10-15 it would probably be worthwhile. Sulbutiamine seems to affect my sleep negatively, like caffeine. I bought 2 or 3 canisters for my third batch of pills along with the theanine. For a few nights in a row, I slept terribly and stayed awake thinking until the wee hours of the morning; eventually I realized it was because I was taking the theanine pills along with the sleep-mix pills, and the only ingredient that was a stimulant in the batch was - sulbutiamine. I cut out the theanine pills at night, and my sleep went back to normal. (While very annoying, this, like the creatine & taekwondo example, does tend to prove to me that sulbutiamine was doing *something* and it is not pure placebo effect.)

It's worth noting that sulbutiamine reports vary dramatically, and it seems possible that some people are thiamine-deficient and so would disproportionately; [SilasBarta](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2q0/intelligence_amplification_open_thread/2mv4?c=1) noticed little to nothing (like me), but [Jimrandomh](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kl/open_thread_august_2010_part_2/2j0z?c=1) reports his life was transformed (and he suspects that his diabetes caused or exacerbated a deficiency).

# Taurine

[Taurine](!Wikipedia) was another gamble on my part, based mostly on its inclusion in energy drinks. I didn't do as much research as I should have: it came as a shock to me when I read in [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Taurine#Physiological functions") that "taurine has been shown to prevent oxidative stress induced by exercise" and was an antioxidant - oxidative stress is a key part of how exercise creates health benefits and antioxidants [*inhibit*](!Wikipedia "Antioxidant#Physical exercise") those benefits.

So now I have to be careful about when I take it so it isn't near a session of exercise or just accept whatever damage taurine does me. I'm not sure what I'll do with it when I cap my current supply of powders. (It would make little sense to cap it with the [creatine](#creatine) since I would often take the creatine before exercise.)

And the effects? Well, if you look through the WP article or other places, you see it justified in part due to supposed long term benefits or effects on [blood sugar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992273). I can't say I've noticed any absence of 'crashes', taking it on alternate days or alone. (At least it wasn't too expensive - [$9 for 500g](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5356-taurine-powder-500-grams.aspx).)

# Theanine

[Theanine](!Wikipedia) is occasionally mentioned on Reddit or Imminst or LessWrong[^lwtheanine] but is rarely a top-level post or article; this is probably because theanine was discovered a very long time ago (>61 years ago), and it's a pretty straightforward substance. It's a weak relaxant/[anxiolytic](!Wikipedia)^[If you don't like Wikipedia's citations on this, see also [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=theanine+anxiety).] which is probably responsible for a number of the [health benefits](!Wikipedia "Health effects of tea") of tea, and [which](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079786) [works](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040626) [synergistically](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988) with [caffeine](#caffeine) (and is probably why caffeine delivered through coffee feels different from the same amount consumed in tea - in one study, separate caffeine and theanine were a mixed bag, but the combination [beat placebo on all measurements](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208) ([PDF](http://www.scicompdf.se/cooldown/haskell_2008.pdf))).

[^lwtheanine]: See for example the mentions in ["A rationalist's guide to psychoactive drugs"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/45u/a_rationalists_guide_to_psychoactive_drugs/) or the discussion in the post ["Coffee: When it helps, when it hurts"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/1qiu); see also the description of a rare [*bad* experience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20w/open_thread_april_2010/1ubp) with theanine.

I purchased from Smart Powders ([20g for $7](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5327-l-theanine-powder-20-grams.aspx)); as before, some light searching seemed to turn up SP as the best seller given shipping overhead. ([Pure Bulk](http://purebulk.com/l-theanine) is apparently another cheap seller.) It was on sale and I planned to cap it so I got 80g. This may seem like a lot, but I was highly confident that theanine and I would get along since I already drink so much tea and was a tad annoyed at the edge I got with straight caffeine. So far I'm pretty happy with it. My goal was to eliminate the physical & mental 'twitchiness' of caffeine, which it seems to do.

# Tryptophan

l-[Tryptophan](!Wikipedia) is in a sense redundant with taking [melatonin](#Melatonin), since melatonin is one of the most prominent metabolites of tryptophan. Nevertheless, subjectively I seem to sleep better by taking 1.5mg of melatonin & 0.5g of tryptophan than I do by taking, say, 3mg of melatonin.

One of the other suggested benefits is for boosting serotonin levels; low levels of serotonin are implicated in a number of issues like depression. I'm not yet sure whether tryptophan has helped with motivation or happiness. Trial and error has taught me that it's a bad idea to take tryptophan in the morning or afternoon, however, even smaller quantities like 0.25g. Like melatonin, the dose-response curve is a U: ~1g is great and induces multiple vivid dreams for me, but ~1.5g leads to an awful night and a headache the next day that was worse, if anything, than melatonin. (One morning I woke up with traces of at least 7 dreams, although I managed to write down only 2. No lucid dreams, though.)

Taking the tryptophan is fairly difficult. The powder as supplied by Bulk Nutrition is *extraordinarily* dry and fine; it seems to be positively [hydrophobic](!Wikipedia). The first time I tried to swallow a teaspoon, I nearly coughed it out - the power had seemed to explode in my mouth and go down my lungs. Thenceforth I made sure to have a mouth of water first. After a while, I took a different tack: I mixed in as much [_Hericium_](#lions-mane-mushroom) as would fit in the container. The mushroom powder is wetter and chunkier than the tryptophan, and seems to reduce the problem. Combining the mix with chunks of melatonin inside a pill works even better.

# Tyrosine

[Tyrosine](!Wikipedia) is an amino acid; people on the Imminst.org forums (as well as Wikipedia) suggest that it helps with energy and coping with stress. I ordered 4oz  (bought from Smart Powders) to try it out, and I began taking 1g with my usual caffeine+piracetam+choline mix. It does not dissolve easily in hot water, and is very chalky and not especially tasty. I have not noticed any particular effects from it.

# Vitamin D

Bought 5,000 IU soft-gels of [Vitamin D](!Wikipedia)-3^[It's important one uses D-3 and not vitamin D-2, [alfacalcidol](!Wikipedia), or [calcitriol](!Wikipedia): the [Cochrane review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub2/abstract) found mortality benefits only with D-3. (And use with calcium doesn't look too good either.)] ([Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/)) because I was feeling very apathetic in January 2011 and not getting much done, even slacking on regular habits like [Mnemosyne spaced repetition review](Spaced repetition) or [dual n-back](DNB FAQ) or my [Wikipedia watchlist](!Wikipedia "Help:Watching pages"). Introspecting, I  was reminded of depression & [dysthymia](!Wikipedia) & [seasonal affective disorder](!Wikipedia). There are a number of treatments for the last. I already use melatonin. I sort of have [light therapy](!Wikipedia) from a [full-spectrum](!Wikipedia "Full-spectrum light") fluorescent desk lamp. But I get very little sunlight; the surprising thing would be if I *didn't* have a vitamin D deficiency. (And vitamin D deficiencies have been linked with all sorts of interesting things like near-sightedness, with [time outdoors](http://bjo.bmj.com/content/93/8/997) inversely correlating with myopia and *not* reading or near-work time.) Given the involvement with circadian rhythms and the synthesis involving direct *sunlight*, it is likely a bad idea to take vitamin D close to bedtime, and there have been anecdotes that it damages sleep quality; I investigated this with [my Zeo](Zeo#vitamin-d) and concluded it seemed to be true for me.

The soft gels are very small; one needs to be a bit careful - Vitamin D is fat-soluble and [overdose starts](!Wikipedia "Hypervitaminosis D") in the range of 70,000 IU^[Although there have been large trials with the elderly using much higher Vitamin D doses, such as [4 doses every year of 100,000 IU](http://www.bmj.com/content/326/7387/469.full), or a single annual dose of [up to 300,000 IU](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1422948) without observed problems.], so it would take at least 14 pills, and it's unclear where problems start with *chronic* use^[Vitamin D, like many supplements, [follows](http://www.ajcn.org/content/69/5/842.full) [a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444937) [U-shaped](http://www.ajcn.org/content/early/2010/08/18/ajcn.2010.29749.abstract) [response](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/03/03/jn.109.119636.abstract) [curve](http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149%2811%2902748-2/abstract) - too much can be quite as bad as too little. Too little, though, can be [very bad](http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2009/jan2009_Millions-of-Needless-Deaths_01.htm). The previously cited studies with high acute doses worked out to <1,000 IU a day, so they may reassure us about the risks of a large acute dose but not tell us much about smaller chronic doses.]. 10,000 IU is probably more than enough and is similar to what one might get from an hour on the beach.

# TODO

- [Bacopa](!Wikipedia "Bacopa monnieri#Medicine") - The research looks interesting and it's [cheap](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5255-bacopa-monnieri-20-powder-75-grams.aspx); but I am suspicious of anything [Ayurvedic](!Wikipedia "Ayurveda#Safety") because of heavy metals, and _Bacopa monnieri_ is a [hyperaccumulator](!Wikipedia "Bacopa monnieri#Phytoremediation") of heavy metals.
- [Naringenin](!Wikipedia) - Timothy Ferriss in excerpt from _Four-hour Body_ claims it extends effectiveness of caffeine (how to buy - capsule? grape fruit concentrate?)

# 3 years supply in pill form

Powders are too annoying, and pills expensive in bulk. So since I'm making my own pills, I might as well make a custom formulation using the ones I've found personally effective. And since making pills is tedious, I want to not have to do it again for years. 3 years seems like a good interval - 1095 days. Since one is often busy and mayn't take that day's pills (there are enough ingredients it has to be multiple pills), it's safe to round it down to a nice even 1000 days. What sort of hypothetical stack could I make? What do the prices come out to be, and what might we omit in the interests of protecting our pocketbook?

We omit tryptophan and melatonin, of course, because they are most useful for sleeping and this is a stimulus pill for daytime usage. That leaves from the above the following, with some basic commercial specs from the usual retailers:

We calculate how many days each unit gets us simply by dose divided by dose per day. We get quite a range; with some products, we only need 4 units to cover at least 1000 days, but we need 100 units for modafinil!

Ingredient        Units   Cost
----------------  -----   ----
aniracetam        6       $300
caffeine          5       $90
choline citrate   4       $68
creatine          4       $68
lithium orotate   8       $88
modafinil         100     $800
sulbutiamine      9       $180
theanine          5       $50

Sum total, $1644, or $1.65 per day for the ingredients.

But how many pills does this make and how much do those pills cost?

[Capsule Connection](http://www.capsuleconnection.com/) sells 1000 00 pills (the largest pills) for $9. I already have a pill machine, so that doesn't count (a sunk cost). If we sum the grams per day column from the first table, we get 9.75 grams a day. Each 00 pill can take around 0.75 grams, so we need 13 pills. (Creatine is very bulky, alas.) 13 pills per day for 1000 days is 13,000 pills, and 1,000 pills is $9 so we need 13 units and 13 times 9 is $117.

Redoing the above, the total expense is $1761 or $1.76 per day.

13 pills a day sounds like a lot, and $1.76 is actually a fair amount per day compared to what most people take. If I couldn't swing a round $1800 (even to cover years of consumption), how would I economize?

Looking at the prices, the overwhelming expense is for modafinil. It's a powerful stimulant - possibly the single most effective ingredient in the list - but dang expensive. Worse, there's anecdotal evidence that one can develop tolerance to modafinil, so we might be wasting a great deal of money on it. (And for me, modafinil isn't even very useful in the daytime: I [can't even notice it](#modalert-blind-day-trial).)  If we drop it, the cost drops by a full $800 from $1761 to $961 (almost halving) and to $0.96 per day. A remarkable difference, and if one were genetically insensitive to modafinil, one would definitely want to remove it.

On the other metric, suppose we removed the creatine? Dropping 4 grams of material means we only need to consume 5.75 grams a day, covered by 8 pills (compared to 13 pills). We save 5,000 pills, which would have cost $45 and also don't spend the $68 for the creatine; assuming a modafinil formulation, that drops our $1761 down to $1648 or $1.65 a day. Or we could remove both the creatine and modafinil, for a grand total of $848 or $0.85 a day, which is pretty reasonable.

<!-- # Iodine

meta-analysis: deficiency = -13 points
supplementation helps pregnancy; not school-aged?
grantham-macgregor fernald sethuraman 1999b

Kazakhstan data:

In fact, Kazakhstan has become an example of how even a vast and still-developing nation like this Central Asian country can achieve a remarkable public health success. In 1999, only 29 percent of its households were using iodized salt. Now, 94 percent are. Next year, the United Nations is expected to certify it officially free of iodine deficiency disorders.
...Largely out of the public eye, they made terrific progress: 25 percent of the world’s households consumed iodized salt in 1990. Now, about 66 percent do.

...In some nations, iodization becomes tarred as a government plot to poison an essential of life — salt experts compare it to the furious opposition by 1950s conservatives to fluoridation of American water. In others, civil libertarians demand a right to choose plain salt, with the result that the iodized kind rarely reaches the poor. Small salt makers who fear extra expense often lobby against it. So do makers of iodine pills who fear losing their market. Rumors inevitably swirl: iodine has been blamed for AIDS, diabetes, seizures, impotence and peevishness. Iodized salt, according to different national rumor mills, will make pickled vegetables explode, ruin caviar or soften hard cheese. Breaking down that resistance takes both money and leadership...The country’s biggest salt company was initially reluctant to cooperate, fearing higher costs, a Unicef report said. Cardiologists argued against iodization, fearing it would encourage people to use more salt, which can raise blood pressure. More insidious, Dr. Sharmanov said, were private companies that sold iodine pills. “They promoted their products in the mass media, saying iodized salt was dangerous,” he said, shaking his head...Asked about the Unicef report saying that Aral Tuz initially resisted iodization on the grounds that it would eat up 7 percent of profits, the company’s president, Ontalap Akhmetov, seemed puzzled. “I’ve only been president three years,” he said. “But that makes no sense.” The expense, he said, was minimal. “Only a few cents a ton.”

...In the 1990s, when the campaign for iodization began, the world’s greatest concentration of iodine-deficient countries was in the landlocked former Soviet republics of Central Asia. All of them — Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghzstan — saw their economies break down with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Across the region, only 28 percent of all households used iodized salt. “With the collapse of the system, certain babies went out with the bathwater, and iodization was one of them,” said Alexandre Zouev, chief Unicef representative in Kazakhstan...That combination is missing in many nations where iodine deficiency remains a health crisis. In nearby Pakistan, for instance, where 70 percent of households have no iodized salt, there are more than 600 small salt producers. [see <http://www.unicef.org/pon95/nutr0009.html>]

> Figure 1 illustrates the geographic distribution of goiter in the US as measured among World War I recruits (we discuss the data further below). In 1924 iodized salt was introduced in the United States explicitly to reduce the goiter rate. This intervention rapidly reduced the incidence of iodine deficiency. Iodization of salt in the US provides a particularly good natural experiment due to the geographic distribution of the disease combined with a rapid, complete treatment. Since there are large in utero effects of iodine deficiency, we should see a significant difference between those born before and after the introduction of iodized salt in locations with low levels of environmental iodine. Those living in high iodine regions provide a control group.

> The probability of assignment to the Air Corps rises significantly in low iodine (i.e. high goiter) counties in the years after the introduction of iodized salt. In the lowest iodine regions, our estimates suggest a 10-20 percent increase in the probability of a man being assigned to the Air Corps after iodization. Using information about average scores of Air and Ground Force recruits we can infer a one-quarter to one half standard deviation increase in average test scores in these regions. The average level of iodine deficiency in the US was significantly lower than in the highest regions, so the overall effect in the US was much more modest, though iodization was undoubtedly extremely cost effective. The increase in cognitive ability due to salt iodization may have contributed a small amount to trend rise in measured IQ that took place over the course of the twentieth century, the so-called Flynn Effect

> Typically, non-deficient populations differ from iodine-deficient populations by approximately 10 IQ points, whereas the whole normal IQ distribution of a population shifts to the left as a result of iodine deficiency^7^. In endemic areas, cretinism can affect up to 15% of the population (de Benoist et al., eds 2004). Bleichrodt and Born (1994) estimate that the average IQ of iodine-deficient groups is 13.5 points lower than the non-deficient groups...Scrimshaw (1998) provides a list of studies and experiments that have been conducted, and which have shown the hindering effects on mental development of iodine deficiency in utero.

> It had been documented that large amounts of iodine could cause hyperthyroidism to develop in some adults and thyrotoxicosis in others...thyrotoxicosis might occur as a result of iodization in those individuals that have suffered from long-term iodine deficiency and whose goiters have become nodular. In such cases, iodine supplementation causes the output of hormone to jump to toxic levels.

> The number of enlisted men started increasing in 1942, and it peaked in the second semester of that year, as well as the first semester of 1943. People born after iodization enlisted in large numbers starting the first semester of 1943. The proportion of recruits going to the Airforce was particularly low in 1943.

> How large are these effects? The highest goiter places have goiter rates of 30. The coefficients (from Table 4) suggest that about 15% more recruits from the highest goiter regions go into the AAF after salt iodization. From Appendix A we know that the Air Force recruits have, on average 9 point higher AGCT scores (almost a half a standard deviation). The average increase for the recruits from that section is therefore 0.15 time 9 points, or 1.35. So the average cognitive ability in the section goes up by greater than one twentieth of a standard deviation. Examining the high-low regressions yields similar figures. In the high goiter group, we have a 5-10 percent higher assignment rate to the AAF after salt iodization. Ten percent times 8 AGCT points results in 0.8 points higher on average, or about a twentieth of a standard deviation. This implies a twentieth of a standard deviation increase in cognitive ability for 25 percent of the US population.

I identify the impact of iodization in three ways: first, in a differences-in-differences framework, I exploit geographic variation in iodine deficiency, as well as the fact that the nationwide campaign to decrease iodine deficiency began in 1922. Second, I use spatial and temporal variation in the introduction of iodized salt across Swiss cantons, and examine whether the level of iodized salt sales at the time of one’s birth affected one’s educational attainment. Third, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and use jumps in sales of iodized salt across Swiss cantons to identify the effect of iodization, by comparing outcomes for those born right before and right after these sudden changes in the treatment environment. These approaches indicate that the eradication of iodine deficiency in previously deficient areas increased the schooling of the population significantly. The effects are larger for females than for males, which is consistent with medical evidence showing that women are more likely to be affected by iodine deficiency disorders than men.
["The Impact of Iodine Deficiency Eradication on Schooling: Evidence from the Introduction of Iodized Salt in Switzerland"](http://www.econ.ed.ac.uk/papers/Swiss_Iod_Educ.pdf) Politi 2010

In a recently published paper, Erica Field, Omar Robles, and Maximo Torero study the effects of iodine deficiency on educational attainment in Tanzania (Field, Robles and Torero 2009). Theirs is the first published paper to link economically significant outcomes to iodine deficiency, and it supports the idea of improved schooling outcomes after iodine supplementation. Interestingly, Field et al. also find bigger effects for females, which could be due either to biological differences or differences associated with intra-household resource allocation and social responses to increased cognition of males and females.

I show that in a conventional Ramsey model, between one-fourth and one-half of the global income distribution can be explained by a single factor: The effect of large, persistent differences in national average IQ on the private marginal product of labor. Thus, differences in national average IQ may be a driving force behind global income inequality. These persistent differences in cognitive ability--which are well-supported in the psychology literature--are likely to be somewhat malleable through better health care, better education, and especially better nutrition in the world’s poorest countries. A simple calibration exercise in the spirit of Bils and Klenow (2000) and Castro (2005) is conducted. I show that an IQ-augmented Ramsey model can explain more than half of the empirical relationship between national average IQ and GDP per worker. I provide evidence that little of the IQ-productivity relationship is likely to be due to reverse causality.

One question of interest is whether the IQ-productivity relationship has strengthened or weakened over the past few decades. Shocks such as the Great Depression and the Second World War were likely to move nations away from their steady-state paths. Further, many countries have embraced market economies in recent decades, a policy change which is likely to have removed non-IQ-related barriers to riches.11 Accordingly, one would expect the IQ-productivity relationship to have strengthened over the decades.
As Table 2 shows, I indeed found this to be the case. I used LV’s IQ data along with Penn World Table data for each decade from 1960 through 1990 (1950 only had 38 relevant observations, and so is omitted). As before, equation (3) was used to estimate the IQ-productivity relationship, while the IQ-elasticity of wages is assumed to equal 1 for simplicity. Both the unconditional R2 and the fraction of the variance explained by the IQ-wage relationship increase steadily across the decades. This is true regardless of the capital share parameter in question. Further, the log-slope of the IQ-productivity relationship has also increased.
11: Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) hypothesize that national average IQ and market institutions are the two crucial determinants of GDP per capita. They provide some bivariate regressions supporting this hypothesis; they show that both variables together explain much more—about 75% of the variance in the level of GDP per capita--than either variable alone, each of which can explain roughly 50%.

The Ramsey-style model of Manuelli and Seshadri (2005) would be a natural extension: In their model, ex-ante differences in total factor productivity of at most 27% interact with education decisions and fertility choices to completely replicate the span of the current global income distribution. In their calibration—less naïve and more complex then the one I present—a 1% rise in TFP (e.g., 1 IQ point) causes a 9% rise in steady- state productivity. Manuelli and Seshadri leave unanswered the question of what those ex-ante differences in TFP might be, but persistent differences in national average IQ are a natural candidate.

> Thirty-seven reported studies, total 12,291 children, were analysed. The effect size was an increase of 0.83, 0.82, and 0.32 SIQP respectively, for the children living in IS communities compared with those living in ID areas with no iodine supplementation, with inadequate iodine supplementation, or children who had received iodine during their mothers' pregnancy and after birth. These equal to 12.45, 12.3, 4.8 IQ points. Compared with that of children whose mothers were persistently exposed to ID, the total effect size of the 21 entries was an increase of 0.58 SIQP (8.7 IQ points) in the group receiving iodine supplementation during pregnancy. Furthermore, there was an increase on 1.15 SIQP of Binet or 0.8 SIQP on Raven Scale (17.25 or 12 IQ points) for children born more than 3.5 years after iodine supplementation program was introduced. The level of iodine nutrition plays a crucial role in the intellectual development of children. The intelligence damage of children exposed to severe ID was profound, demonstrated by 12.45 IQ points loss and they recovered 8.7 IQ points with iodine supplementation or IS before and during pregnancy

> The results indicated that for children who resided in regions with a very high water iodine concentration, there was on average a reduction of IQ by nearly nine points (b = −8.7, 95% CI: −15.9 to −1.4) in comparison with those who resided in a non-high water iodine area. When comparing children living in areas with a high water iodine concentration with those in the non-high areas, a slight reduction of IQ by about two points was observed, however, it was not significant. There was also a significant association between year of birth and IQ, which seemed to exhibit a dose–response relationship. There was a progressive increase in IQ by about four (P = 0.072) and eight (P = 0.015) points for children born in 1996 and 1997 when compared with those who were born in 1995, the year China first implemented the national dietary iodine supplement programme.

> Our findings suggest that reducing fetal IDD has significant benefits for child cognition: Children who receive iodine in utero attain an average of 0.33 years of education above siblings and older and younger children in their district. Furthermore, the effects appear to be substantially larger for girls, consistent with new evidence from laboratory studies in animals indicating greater cognitive sensitivity of the female fetus to in utero iodine deprivation, including sex-specific responses to maternal thyroid hormone restriction on  expression of neural thyroid hormone receptors. The results are consistent across household and district fixed effects models and patterns of variation in estimated effects are consistent with predictions regarding the  vulnerability of specific subpopulations to fetal IDD. Cross-country regression estimates indicate a strong negative influence of total goiter rate and strong positive influence of salt iodization on female school participation.
