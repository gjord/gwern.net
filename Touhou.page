<!-- TODO: from Culture is not about esthetics: mv here?
[^touhou]: This is a general assertion that is fairly hard to prove, but an example may be suggestive. The [Touhou](!Wikipedia "Touhou Project") doujinshi-game phenomenon has a [fair amount of music](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Music), but to get a sense of the true scale, we can look at some numbers. From the talk ["Riding on Fans' Energy: Touhou, Fan Culture, and Grassroot Entertainment"](http://cardcaptor.moekaku.com/?p=112) ([Barcamp](!Wikipedia) Bangkok 2 on August 31, 2008):

    > Touhou is [ZUN](!Wikipedia "Team Shanghai Alice#Member")'s work as much as it is a gigantic repertoire of fan-made manga, games, music, and video clips. I estimate that there are roughly at least three thousands short manga, five hundred music rearrangement albums, and one hundred derivative games created since 2003. These works are traded mainly in conventions dedicated to them, and some commercial firms are starting to capitalize on their popularity. Doujinshi shops like [Tora no Ana](!Wikipedia "Comic Toranoana") and [Mandarake](!Wikipedia) have shelves dedicate to Touhou comics. And Amazon.co.jp are carrying CDs of arranged/sampled Touhou music (but not ZUN's originals). More and more people are attracted to the franchise because its diverse derivative works provide a variety of entry points for potential fans. In fact, Touhou's popularity skyrocketed when it became one of the killer content of [Nico Nico Douga](!Wikipedia), a Japanese equivalent of YouTube launched one year and a half earlier. There, Touhou content spread like wild fire and gave rise to many recurring memes and tens of thousands of mashup videos. To give a sense of how popular Touhou is in Nico Nico Douga, 18 of 100 most viewed videos are Touhou-related, and the best Touhou video ranks the 6th. [[5]](http://cardcaptor.moekaku.com/?p=112#touhou-popularity-in-nico-nico-douga)

    For a recent estimate, we can turn to [TV Tropes](!Wikipedia)'s [article](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CrowningMusic/TouhouProject) on Touhou music:

    > The Touhou Project really gets a lot of great pieces of music for [the music] being [originally] made up by a single guy with a synthesizer. To put the sheer number of remix CDs in perspective, there is a torrent with over 870.4 gigabytes of over 3000 Touhou remixes, and that only includes the ones that the (English-speaking) maintainers of the torrent have added.

    (This is outdated; the October 2011 lossless torrent is [1,020 gigabytes](http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=torrentinfo&tid=255825). Personally, [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOUHOUMUSIC/search?q=author%3A%27gwern%27&restrict_sr=on) enjoy the orchestral pieces like the [WAVE](http://www.circle-wave.net/) group's [Luna Forest (第七楽章)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhDNC12hWKc).)

16:19:10 <@gwern> Speed: it is difficult to explain. also, it's much more than 44k
16:19:23 < klfwip> speed, touhou is a video game franchise which has one of the best fan bases in the world.
16:19:24 <@gwern> that's just that one highly incomplete torrent
16:19:28 < Speed> I've found the Touhou Project on wikipedia
16:19:40 < Speed> but that one seems to list maybe 10 CD's
16:19:48 < klfwip> they have multiple festivals per year in japan almost completely devoted to selling touhou music and other collectables
16:21:13 <@gwern> klfwip: actually, I'm not entirely sure about that... I think zun may've put out his stuff under a custom license
16:21:58 <@gwern> http://cardcaptor.moekaku.com/?p=125 eg
16:22:08 <@gwern> http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki:Copyrights#Copyright_status.2FTerms_of_Use_of_the_Touhou_Project
16:22:40 <@gwern> this seems pretty unusual for doujin works, but both touhou and vocaloid are big enough that they've'd to've make things more explicit
16:24:23 <@gwern> Speed: nope. I think it's heavily biased toward recent music, the growth seems too rapid
16:24:44 < Speed> how much Touhou music does then exist by your estimations?
16:25:56 <@gwern> Speed: I'm not sure yt. I haven't cleaned the data enough to get a good idea of the counts, and I can't run a capture-recapture estimate of the total universe until the data has improved
16:26:09 <@gwern> Speed: I wouldn't be too surprised if it were >100k though
16:26:30 < klfwip> for every big artist who releases dozens of albums, I suspect there are thousands who post one vocaloid mix of a touhou song to niconico
                   video.
16:26:39 < Siod> how is most touhou music made?
16:27:23 < Speed> I'm still not entirely able to believe that many derivatives could have been made from just a few soundtracks
16:27:39 < Siod> what? it's all derived from soundtracks?
16:27:41 < klfwip> speed, there are hundreds of original touhou songs.
16:27:47 < Speed> klfwip: since you have a collection, can you give me a few samples of the music?
16:27:58 < klfwip> electro, classical, metal, what do you want?
16:28:04 <@gwern> Speed: oh come on, that's like saying 'I don't know how there can be thousands of apocrypha when there's onyl like a hundred canonical books
                  in the bible'
16:28:25 <@gwern> or, 'I don't know how there can be 300m+ books in total'
16:28:26 < klfwip> and some of them honestly have very little in comon with the source except a melody.
16:28:38  * gwern links Speed to https://xkcd.com/915/
16:31:55 <@gwern> Burninate: remixes, distant inspirations, borrowing a hook or melody... they can be remixes in the same way Book of Mormon is a remix of
                  Zoroastrianism
16:32:34 < quanticle> gwern: More apropos, it's like saying, "I don't know how a single 5-second drum and bass solo can give rise to an entire genre of music."
                      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break
16:33:46 < quanticle> gwern: Yeah. Pretty much the entire DNB scene is made up of derivatives and riffs on Amen Break.
16:35:59 < Speed> gwern: so, how does one then classify something as Touhou music or not?
16:36:02 <@gwern> but it's only 'indie' because zun can make a living off it
16:37:04 <@gwern> Speed: well, obviously if something is a rearrangement of an existing Zun track like 'Shanghai Teahouse', it's touhou, but there are a lot of
                  marginal cases where it's simply social - does the creator consider it touhou? did they use touhou-related artowkr or characters? do they
                  thank zun?
16:37:38 < klfwip> some really big names in the touhou scene also have succesful careers are pro musicians outside of it.
16:37:49 <@gwern> nothing stops people from writing their own music without reference to the canonical Zun melodies or themes and simply branding it as Touhou
16:37:57 < klfwip> if they don't call a particular album a touhou remix album, I would just assume it not to be.
16:38:14 < Burninate> So Zun made 15 games.  Himself.  Without involving a studio (dojin).
16:38:28 < Burninate> and then fans made a bunch of derivatives of those 15 games
16:38:42 <@gwern> Burninate: hm, wasn't the last one or two a collaboration with another group? is that 15 counting the collaborations?
16:38:44 < Burninate> songs, other games, anime, comics
16:38:46 <@gwern> novels
16:38:48 < klfwip> correct
16:39:01 < Burninate> the descriptions are confusing as fuck
16:39:05  * Tuxedage would like to add that Zun is insanely talented
16:39:07 < Tuxedage> Except for the art
16:39:10 < klfwip> gwern, also the earliest games were not under his control, remember.

Idea: correlate Touhou music production against Japanese youth unemployment: does the total production of music as measured in seconds increase with unemployment?

Opposite view, recessions dent production (perhaps because people are working harder and so have less free time even if other people are unemployed?) http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/12/sound_current_yokohamas_mediam.php

> While the turnout at M3 remains strong, at the same time an economic recession cannot help but touch a community whose activities rely on having free time. Furthermore while previously many hobbyists dreamed of someday breaking into the industry, more recently many also fear that game companies will begin cracking down on unlicensed tributes.

TODO Suggestions: http://www.reddit.com/r/TOUHOUMUSIC/comments/19hh2m/touhou_music_databases_comprehensive_easily/ http://boards.4chan.org/jp/res/10559057

alternative sources

- [VGMdb Touhou entries](http://vgmdb.net/product/9) but it is substantially smaller with metadata on <1389 albums
- The open source alternative is [MusicBrainz](!Wikipedia); looks like [it has 190 albums](http://musicbrainz.org/tag/touhou/release), but like 90%+ link to VGMdb, so I'm not sure I want to include them (waste of effort, and if someone just copied over all of VGMdb a few years ago, it'll be badly misleading to any capture-recapture analysis of population size).
- [Touhouwiki.net](http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Doujin_circles) another source, with <1182 albums
- "東方音団録 ～ Arrange Circle Database ver.3.0"; [homepage](http://www16.atwiki.jp/toho) & [release info](http://www16.atwiki.jp/toho/pages/727.html) ([debate](http://www16.atwiki.jp/toho/pages/13.html), [chat](http://www16.atwiki.jp/toho/pages/948.html)), [product page](http://www.toranoana.jp/bl/article/04/0030/04/86/040030048682.html) with j-subculture.com quoting a partial total of $15, Paypal and shipping outside Japan boosting to ~$30! (Alternative proxies included [Yokatta](http://yokattaweb.jp/index.html).)

   Strategy: first I'll ask for an Arrange CD download in the wiki's chatroom; then I'll look for an email by someone running it and email them directly; then I'll see if there's anyone in Japan who either owes me a favor or is willing to do me a favor; then I'll ask around for a cheaper reshipper; and if all that fails, then I'll pay j-subculture's extortionate $25 probable total cost.

   Email in 1 March 2013 failed to elicit any reply by 27 May; then [requested a purchase](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOUHOUMUSIC/comments/1f61p6/request_anyone_ordering_from_tora_no_ana_soon/ "[request] Anyone ordering from Tora no Ana soon? (self.TOUHOUMUSIC)") on `/r/TOUHOUMUSIC.

Need more databases for capture-recapture analysis!

<!--
The ISO file seems to be broken: `file` just calls it 'data', and when I mount it as a loopback iso9660 file, `mount` throws an error. I redownloaded it and compared it, but the copies were identical.

The good news is that the zip file seems to work fine. The data is in a .accdb file in a subfolder, which turns out to be the latest Microsoft Access database format. Unfortunately, this turns out to be almost entirely unsupported by anything on Linux (except for a Java library), but fortunately, an acquaintance had an Office 365 subscription and re-exported the .accdb file as a .mdb file (the older Access format) which was successfully read and converted to CSV by `mdb-tools`. The entries look like this:

## VGMdb

The [Touhou project page](http://vgmdb.net/product/9) turns out to be incomplete: each entry had to be manually annotated as related to Touhou. I was pointed to [a search query](http://vgmdb.net/search?do=results&id=161863) which turned up many more results by looking for any page with the string "Touhou" in the "games" field.

The VGMdb administrators kindly gave me read-only access to their MySQL databases. I grabbed the entirety of the tables `vgmdb_albums` and `vgmdb_tracks` from the main VGMdb database; I exported them as 2 CSV files with comma separators, renamed `2013-vgmdb-albums.csv` and `2013-vgmdb-tracks.csv`. Before loading the exports, I had to delete all escaped quotes; the default R CSV parsing doesn't handle them. The track rows are 1 track with an album ID, so to turn each track record/row into an equivalent of the torrent rows, I need to fill in based on the album table.

~~~{.R}
albums <- read.csv("http://www.gwern.net/docs/touhou/2013-vgmdb.csv")

           data.frame(albumid,reldate,publisher,game,albumtitles))

## Personal downloads
### 4chan /jp/ C83 threads

A loose group of [4chan](!Wikipedia) users on the [/jp/](https://boards.4chan.org/jp/) subforum collaborate each Comiket to upload and distribute doujin manga, games, and music released at that Comiket; some are uploaded by Comiket attendees, some are bought from resellers like [Comic Toranoana](!Wikipedia), and many files are harvested from Japanese P2P filesharing networks like [Winny](!Wikipedia)/[Share](!Wikipedia "Share (P2P)")/[Perfect Dark](!Wikipedia "Perfect Dark (P2P)"). I compiled a list of ~400 files from the [/r/TouhouMusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOUHOUMUSIC/comments/15pp33/c83_resource_thread/) C83 thread (principally from the 4chan links) & the blog [All Doujin Music](http://alldoujinmusic.wordpress.com) and gradually downloaded them from January to March 2013. After dead links, I was left with 400-500 files. Many are not music, or even Touhou-related, so I hand-filtered albums, looking for signs of being Touhou doujin works (credits to ZUN, Touhou characters in the artwork, themes I recognized as Touhou, etc); when I was not sure, I erred on the side of exclusion. The [final compilation](/docs/touhou/2013-c83-downloads.txt) yielded 3503 files (evenly split: 1776 Touhou vs 1728 "other") with 953 Touhou music files.

## Growth over time

How fast is the corpus of Touhou music growing?

Constant growth model: the first game was released in 1996, no? So that gives 17 years to accumulate 1.26TB or 1,260GB or 74.1GB per year. The screenshot is downloading at 0kb/s, which is not useful, but it says 2640 days left so we can estimate that he's downloading at 0.47GB per day (`1260/2640`), and over a year 0.47GB is 174GB which is 2.35x faster than the 74GB per year. So at that annual increase, OP is *not* doomed and can in fact catch up.

Exponential growth mode: a little trickier since we can't force a formula just from the cumulative total and elapsed time. I need more data. So using my 2012 Touhou Lossy Torrent data, I can try to regress an exponential against the annual count... but wait! The amount of music does not seem to be increasing exponentially!

    R> touhou <- read.csv("http://www.gwern.net/docs/touhou/2013-torrent.csv",
    +                    colClasses=c("character", "integer", "factor", "character",
    +                                         "integer", "factor", "character",
    +                                         "character", "numeric", "integer",
    +                                         "factor", "Date"))
    R> summary(touhou$Year)
    R> perYear <- table(touhou$Year); perYear; plot(perYear)

     2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012
       13    23   255  1241  2070  2599  5073 10278  9765  7494  2999

Graph: http://i.imgur.com/23fMA5c.png

Looks like Touhou music's growth peaked in 2009; this might reflect the torrent's incompleteness, except the torrent is from 2012, and you'd expect coverage of 2010 or 2011 to be pretty good by that point. So the growth of the torrent *overall* looks more like a sigmoid or log:

    R> runningTotal <- cumsum(table(touhou$Year)); runningTotal; plot(runningTotal)
     2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012
       13    36   291  1532  3602  6201 11274 21552 31317 38811 41810

http://i.imgur.com/Lv9vHrZ.png

So probably it'd be better to ask, 'if 2012-rate growth continues, what is the ratio to his download speed?'

2012 added 19.5GB to the torrent:

    R> # FileSize is in megabytes, so gigabytes
    R> sum(touhou[touhou$Year==2012,]$FileSize, na.rm=TRUE) / 1000
    [1] 19.5

## VGMdb scraping code

The following is a buggy program for scraping Touhou albums from VGMdb; it works on a limited subset of album pages, but has an unknown number of fatal bugs. I abandoned it once I was offered read-only database access, and that was what I actually used to get my VGMdb data. This is in case I ever need to go back.
