# Media
## Books

Fiction:

- _The Quantum Thief_, Hannu (_Accelerando_ meets _Lupin_; uncompromising SF, stuffed full of interesting tidbits - the game-theoretic prison at the beginning is only the beginning; self-recommending)
- _Catch-22_, Heller (I reread it out of curiosity to see how it'd hold up after all these years. I still enjoyed it.)

Nonfiction:

- _Wages of Destruction_, Tooze 2006 ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/373143104?book_show_action=false))
- [_Game Programming Patterns_](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/927149987?book_show_action=false))
- [_Letters from a Stoic_](http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103) (Campbell's translation of Seneca letters; some [excerpts](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/92UftFA3ndu))

## Film/TV

Movies:

- [_The Thing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_%281982_film%29)

    I enjoyed this a great deal. The special effects hold up well, I liked the suspense & paranoia especially since I had no idea how the plot goes and really was unsure who would be assimilated, and the characters don't act *too* stupidly for *most* of the movie.
- _Dr. Strangelove_
- _Her_
- [_Nebraska_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_%28film%29) 2013 (??? My relatives say this is a good depiction of the more Scandinavian parts of the Midwest but it left me deeply nonplussed)

Anime:

- [_Summer in Andalusia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasu:_Summer_in_Andalusia) (Ghibli-esque movie about a professional cycling race in Spain; better than it sounds)
- _Ghost Hound_ (attempt at psychological/supernatural horror that ultimately falls short of building up to anything interesting)
- _Un-go_ (lame mysteries in the worst Sherlock tradition, offputting fan-service, not one but two major deus ex machinas; stick to something like _Umineko_)

Interestingly, this is for studies early in the drug pipeline, while IIRC the usual studies examine drugs later in the approval pipeline and which have reached human clinical trials. This immediately suggests an economic rationale: early in the process, drug companies have incentives to reach true results in order to avoid investing much in drugs which won't ultimately work; but later in the process, because they've managed to get a drug close to approval, they have incentives to cook the books in order to try to force approval regardless. So for preliminary results, you would want to distrust academic work and trust industry findings, but then at some point flip your assessments and start assuming the opposite. Makes me wonder what the midpoint is where neither group is more untrustworthy?)
