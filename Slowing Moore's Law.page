> Brain emulation requires enormous computing power. Enormous computing power requires further progression of Moore's law. Further Moore's law relies on large-scale production of cheap processors in chip fabs. Chip fabs are both expensive and vulnerable. Therefore, the advent of brain emulation can be delayed by attacks on chip fabs.

There are 2 main routes to Singularity, brain emulation/upload and de novo AGI. The former is estimated as more straightforward engineering than the latter, but is [expected to take](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3853/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf "'Whole Brain Emulation A Roadmap', Sandberg & Bostrom 2008") from 10^18^ FLOPS^[Analog network population mode] (supercomputer estimate: by 2019) to 10^43 FLOPS^[Stochastic behavior of single molecules] (supercomputers by 2111) to do in comparison with the latter which either takes a similar amount (if it is as inefficient as emulated brains and winds up effectively being a synthetic upload) or potentially much less if there are efficient algorithms and optimizations unavailable to evolution through brains or unavailable period with brains. Hence, we expect that uploads will be made more likely by powerful hardware and de novo AGI be made more likely by powerful software/algorithms/mathematical insight. This observation immediately suggests that any slowing in hardware developed will reduce the probability of uploads coming before de novo AGI (whatever that probability is), and vice versa, any slowing in software/math will reduce the probability of de novo AGI coming before uploads (whatever that probability was). A slowing in both may not change the probabilities or relative dates of them, but rather postpone the appearance of either or both.

Uploaded brains are frequently regarded as highly untrustworthy and dangerous, constituting an existential risk. If an organization (such as a [singleton world government](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html "'What is a Singleton?', Bostrom 2005") like the UN Security Council) wanted to [shift probability](!Wikipedia "Differential technological development") towards de novo AGI (the desirability of uploads is contentious, with [pro](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/12/hurry-or-delay-ems.html "Hurry Or Delay Ems?") and [con](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/9oq/link_2011_team_may_be_chosen_to_receive_14/5zow)), then they might withhold subsidies from hardware research & development, regulate it, or even actively oppose it with penalties ranging from the financial to the civil to the military.

How feasible is this? The relevant measure of progress, Moore's law, has operated reliably since the 1950s, over more than 60 years, and has even sped up at times. This would suggest it is difficult to slow down or reverse this particular kind of technological progress.

On the other hand, at no point in those 60 years has anyone seriously attempted to slow down Moore's law, and any attempt to do so will have been through ordinary commercial methods, which are highly limited in what coercion can be applied. In particular, that 60 year period has been unusually favorable for technological development, with no major wars in the relevant nations like Japan, Taiwan, or America. Had Moore's law survived a multilateral thermonuclear exchange, that would be evidence for robustness. Had Moore's law survived legal assault like peer-to-peer filesharing has, that would be evidence for robustness. But in fact, Moore's law has been heavily favored by government subsidies to research as American computer & semiconductor capabilities were seen as a major advantage over the Soviet Union during the Cold War; and they have continued, as with the end of the Cold War, computers also became a key part of the American economy and self-image. ('We may not have manufacturing', the elites say, 'but we're still the best Internet and computer economy in the world! Just learn you some computer stuff and there is a good job waiting in Economy 2.0 for you!' There is some truth to this.) Where there is sufficient political will, even the most dramatic and accessible technology can die out - witness Tokugawa-era Japan's [suppression of firearms](!Wikipedia "Firearms of Japan").

To shut down Moore's law, one can attack either the potential for future improvements or the existence of current capability:

1. If all research ended today, then obviously Moore's law would quickly die: some efficiency can be ironed out of existing production capability, but these price drops would quickly hit an asymptote.
2. If research continued, but all chip fabs were destroyed, the knowledge would be sterile as every chip would be produced in small hand-made quantities; and the complexity of every additional advance would make each batch more expensive. (Price cuts *must* be realized at [scale](!Wikipedia "Economies of scale")^[[Experience curve effects](!Wikipedia "Experience curve effects#The experience curve") are one of the more robust observations in manufacturing: the more you make & for longer, the more experience or intelligence builds up in your facilities & humans, and the cheaper or better they can make them. [Nagy et al 2010](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bn/workingpapers/NagyFarmerTrancikBui.pdf "Testing Laws of Technological Progress") observes the curve in 61 areas. The curve may be [related to Moore's law.](http://www.electroiq.com/articles/sst/print/volume-46/issue-7/features/fab-management/using-learning-curve-theory-to-redefine-moores-law.html "Using learning curve theory to redefine Moore's Law")].)

# Targets for Regulation

When examing a system to speed it up or slow it down, one wants as much leverage as possible, to manipulate central nodes. In a highly distributed network, manipulation may be difficult to impossible as no node is especially important: the system can only be manipulated by manipulating a large fraction of the nodes. But many networks are not very distributed, and may looks more like a butterfly or follow the [bow tie organizational architecture](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.3019&rep=rep1&type=pdf "'Bow ties, metabolism and disease', Csete & Doyle 2004") seen in cellular metabolism:

> "...a myriad of nutrient sources are catabolized, or ‘fan in’, to produce a handful of activated carriers (e.g. ATP, NADH  and NADPH) and 12 precursor metabolites (e.g. glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate), which are then synthesized into roughly 70 larger building blocks (e.g. amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids and sugars). The precursors and carriers can be thought of as two ‘knots’ of separate bow ties that are both fed by catabolism, but whereas the former ‘fan out’ locally to the biosynthesis of universal building blocks, the latter fan out to the whole cell to provide energy, reducing power and small moieties..."

While the Internet is famously distributed and does not at first glance follow any bow tie network, the semiconductor industry is amazingly *centralized*: [<14 companies](!Wikipedia "Category:Foundry semiconductor companies") make up the majority of global manufacturing. [Much of the industry](!Wikipedia "Fabless semiconductor company") (like [AMD](!Wikipedia "Advanced Micro Devices") or [ARM](!Wikipedia "ARM Holdings")) does not actually possess large manufacturing facilities; they focus on research, design, and licensing. The facilities require myriads of skills, resources, and tools, and also as in a bow tie, the outputs of these few facilities are shipped world-wide to be used in countless applications in every field of endeavour. The chip fabs look very much like the knot of a bow tie and where we might want to start.

# Fab costs and requirements

The costs they bear to build each chip fabrication plant is astounding; the basic equipment alone begin in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, lithography machines were $40 million a piece in 2009, and the most expensive single pieces of equipment (like steppers) can reach prices as high as $50 million dollars. The facilities are equally impressive: [Intel](!Wikipedia)'s Fab 11X has 400,000 square feet of [cleanrooms](!Wikipedia) a quarter-mile on a side. Chip fabs use upwards of 40 miles of [pipes](!Wikipedia "Polyvinylidene fluoride") for their ultra-pure water (pipes which expand in diameter each generation, [Klaiber's law](!Wikipedia)) with the internal monorail transportation can be 3 miles long, and the clean rooms must be constructed with custom pre-cleaned construction materials. (Cement consumption is so high that Intel just builds cement plants on their sites.) Chip fab energy consumption is measured in megawatts, 55-65 megawatts in one case. Intel [cheerfully notes](https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2012/01/what%E2%80%99s-behind-the-products-you-love-2/ "What's Behind the Products you Love?") about its Fab 42 construction:

> "First of all, Intel is using the largest land-based crane in the world – one that can pick up and place massive roof trusses that weigh approximately 300 tons each. The crane is so large it had to be delivered on trucks to the site in pieces – approximately 250 truck loads in total. Additionally, Fab 42 will require 24,000 tons of steel rebar and 21,000 tons of structural steel. And to make room for the fab, 875,000 cubic yards of dirt had to be excavated. When all is said and done, approximately 10.5 million man hours will be required to complete the project."

A fab cost ~$1.5b in 1998, $2b in 2004, $3b in 2007, and $5b by 2010. [Jurvetson](ttp://www.dfj.com/files/TranscendingMoore.pdf "Transcending Moore's Law with Molecular Electronics and Nanotechnology") wrote in 2004 that

> "Another problem is the escalating cost of a semiconductor fab plant, which is doubling every three years, a phenomenon dubbed Moore's Second Law. Human ingenuity keeps shrinking the CMOS transistor, but with increasingly expensive manufacturing facilities – currently $3 billion per fab."

[Ross 2003](/docs/2003-ross.pdf "5 Commandments [technology laws and rules of thumb]") didn't foresee the coming explosion in prices in describing Moore's Second Law, or Rock's law as he prefers:

> "Sometimes called Moore’s Second Law, because Moore first spoke of it publicly in the mid-1990s, we are calling it Rock’s Law because Moore himself attributes it to Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel, who noted that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years. By this logic, chip fabrication plants, or fabs, were supposed to cost $5 billion each by the late 1990s and $10 billion by now.
>
> Not so. VLSI Research estimates that fabs cost $2 billion apiece, the same as in the late 1990s, even as their productivity has gone up. “In the 1980s, the fabs increased their yield; in the 1990s, they started [increasing] their throughput,” Hutcheson says. (Throughput refers to the number of wafers a fab produces in a given time.) Wafer throughput rose from 20 per hour in the early 1990s to about 40 to 50 an hour today.
>
> Anyhow, the focus was wrongheaded; what matters is not the cost of the fab but the value of its product. If a $100 billion fab made so many transistors per penny that it could undercut the prices of a $10 billion competitor, it would be economical (if, of course, you could get the seed capital together from a coalition of companies—or continents)."^[A caveat that will becoming increasingly important in coming decades.]

Intel's Fab 32 [cost an estimated $3b](http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2007/20071025corp.htm "Intel Opens First High-Volume 45nm Microprocessor Manufacturing Factory") in 2007 (clean rooms: 184,000 square feet; total: 1 million square feet), revised to $3.5b by 2011. A [2009-2010 upgrade](http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2009/07/20/daily73.html?page=all "Intel’s NM clean room huge endeavor") to an Intel fab, Fab 11X, cost $2.5b (on top of the $2b upgrade in 2007). The 'first stage' of [GlobalFoundries](!Wikipedia)'s [New York](http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/At-last-chips-from-chip-fab-2450917.php "At last, chips from chip fab: Fab 8 has started limited chip production at Luther Forest") [1.3 million square foot](http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/01/11/focus2.html?page=all) fab will cost [>$4.6 billion dollars](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362026,00.asp) ($1b reportedly [supplied by New York State](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Construction-Of-Chip-twst-2711924876.html)).  Intel's Fab 42 (begun 2011-2012) is projected at >$10b. [TSMC](!Wikipedia)'s Fab 15 in Taiwan is estimated at >$9.3 billion, and they are preparing to start a fab in 2015 projected at [>$26 billion](http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4233169/Report-TSMC-land-for-fab "Report: TSMC reserves land for $26 billion fab"). Involved companies are resorting to collaborations to cover the capital costs, even for the largest players (eg. Intel & [Micron](!Wikipedia "Micron Technology") building a $3b+ Flash fab [together](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Construction-Of-Chip-twst-2711924876.html)) The trend shows little sign of abating for a variety of reasons[^Kim], and vastly outpaces inflation. At current rates, it is not impossible that chip fabs may pass the $100b (inflation-adjusted) mark somewhere in the 2020s or 2030s - well before a number of the Bostrom-Sandberg estimates for hardware power reaching brain emulation levels.

[^Kim]: [Kim 2008](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~martha/papers/MarthaKim_Dissertation.pdf), "Brick and Mortar Chip Fabrication":

    > "Technology scaling has produced a wealth of transistor resources and corresponding improvements in chip performance. However, these benefits come with an increasing price tag, due to rising design, engineering, and validation costs of modern chips [15]. The result has been a steady decline in unique application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that enter production [21]. This initiates a vicious cycle. Fewer unique chips means that fabs have fewer customers across which to amortize their costs, leading to even higher costs for those who do manufacture chips. The cycle completes as higher chip manufacturing costs exclude even more potential manufacturing customers.
    >
    > 1.1 The problem with Moore’s Law
    >
    > While Moore’s Law has fueled the semiconductor industry, it has also fueled this spiral of increasing costs and shrinking fab customer bases. As transistors have shrunk, the cost of fabricating a semiconductor device has grown commensurately. While the fabrication cost per transistor has steadily declined [62], multiple other expenses have ballooned, contributing collectively to the growing total. For example, small features are more susceptible to process variation than larger ones, increasing the range of variation and the proportion of faulty chips. In addition, the smaller the transistor, the more of them that can fit in a given amount of silicon. The result is that circuit complexity has been increasingly out-stripping designer productivity, in a phenomenon referred to as Moore’s Law’s corollary of “compound complexity” [143].
    >
    > The industry has dealt with these challenges by increasing the engineering effort that goes into each chip. This effort manifests itself as larger design teams, or longer product cycles, and often both at once. The vast majority of this engineering effort is incurred once per chip design, and does not vary with the number of chips produced. Accordingly, this expense is called the non-recurring engineering cost (NRE) of a chip. Industry analysts estimate that the NREs for a typical 90nm standard cell ASIC can range from $5M up to $50M [113].
    >
    > Maintaining a particular price per chip in the face of skyrocketing NREs requires larger and larger batches of chips. This is because the single NRE is shared evenly across the population of chips produced. The larger the population, the smaller the impact of the NRE on individual chip cost, so chips produced in large batches cost less than chips produced in small batches. Growing NREs are pushing the line that divides “small” from “large” higher and higher. The result of this situation is that only high-volume chip manufacturers, or those who can sell smaller batches at high prices, can afford to be in the chip business. Moreover, at the same time that complexity and engineering effort have been soaring, the commercial market has been demanding and rewarding short chip design cycles. This is due to shrinking product lifetimes and the increasing competitive importance of being the first to market with a new product.
    >
    > ...One of the inputs is the assumed NRE. The NRE includes all engineering effort encompassing circuit design, RTL implementation, functional verification, and physical verification of signal integrity, power, and timing. This can take large teams a long time, and with an engineer’s time costing upwards of $380,000 per year [141], the engineering cost is nearly always a seven-figure number. While the engineering cost usually accounts for the largest share of the NRE, the sum includes several other expenses. NREs also encompass the cost of tools, IP licenses if necessary, and photolithographic masks. ASIC design tools typically cost more than $300,000 [146]. Mask cost has been roughly doubling every technology node, resulting in a complete set of 90nm masks costing between $1M and $3M [146]...In 2000, the cost to test each transistor was 10% of the cost to manufacture it. However, as transistors become cheaper and testing becomes more difficult, it is projected that by 2015 it will cost more to test a transistor than to make it [73]."

# Financial fragility

This leads to an interesting question: if a chip fab were destroyed, how well would the company weather it? It is difficult to answer this, but I will note that Intel's 2010 revenue was $54b, TSMC's was $14b and GlobalFoundries's was $3.5b. It is not clear that chip foundry companies could survive the destruction of one or two of their fabs now, much less how financially robust they will be after another cost doubling or two.

Or will the doublings continue? If it ceases to become profitable to build chip fabs capable of building *faster* chips, or to upgrade the fabs, this suggests that Moore's law may come to an end on its own without any kind of intervention. One analyst is already forecasting the death of new fabs and hence, a slowing or end to Moore's law[^Jelinek]. Some simple economic models put the shutdown between 2015 and 2025[^Rupp].

[^Jelinek]: ["Moore’s Law reaches its economic limits"](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/01c8b5aa-754e-11de-9ed5-00144feabdc0.html), _Financial Times_ 2012:

    > "“The high cost of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is making continued chipmaking advancements too expensive to use for volume production, relegating Moore’s Law to the laboratory and altering the fundamental economics of the industry,” wrote Len Jelinek, chief analyst for semiconductor manufacturing at the iSuppli research firm, last month.
    >
    > Mr Jelinek predicted that Moore’s Law would no longer drive volume chip production from 2014, sparking intense debate in Silicon Valley. His reasoning is that circuitry widths will dip to 20nm (nanometres or billionths of a metre) or below by that date. But the tools to make them would be too expensive for companies to recover their costs over the lifetime of production.
    >
    > The costs and risks involved in building new fabs have already driven many makers of logic chips (processor or controller chips) towards a “fabless” chip model, where they outsource much of their production to chip “foundries” in the Far East.
    >
    > The 14 chipmakers who were in the game at the 90nm level have been reduced to nine at the current 45nm level. Only two of them – Intel and [Samsung](!Wikipedia) – have firm plans for 22nm factories. Intel argues that only companies with about $9bn in annual revenues can afford to be in the business of building new fabs, given the costs of building and operating the factories and earning a decent 50 per cent margin. That leaves just Intel, Samsung, [Toshiba](!Wikipedia), [Texas Instruments](!Wikipedia) and [STMicroelectronics](!Wikipedia)."
[^Rupp]: ["The Economic Limit to Moore's Law"](http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/pdf/ib_2010/JB2011_Rupp_1.pdf), Rupp & Selberherr 2011

    > "...The reduced growth model (10) can be interpreted in the following way; as long as fab costs increase with the same rate as they did in the past, the number of transistors per chip also increases at the same rate as in the past. However, as soon as fab costs hit an economic barrier given by εg(t), fab costs can only increase at the same rate as the GWP [Global World Product] does. Consequently, transistor counts will also grow at a reduced rate...
   >
   > The prediction of the time at which we run into economic limitations is very sensitive with respect to the fab costs parameter ε; choosing ε = 0.03%, a growth reduction is predicted around 2025, whereas the choice ε = 0.01% shows first signs of reduced growth already in 2015. Thus, with joint funding of large fabs, an economic growth capping can be shifted many years into the future so that we might face limitations imposed by physics first."

(The R&D efforts needed to support fabs may be similarly increasing: ["...R&D costs are rapidly increasing. In 2009, around $30 billion, or 17 percent of revenue, went to R&D across the industry--a 40 percent increase over 1999."](http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/25141/ "The High Cost of Upholding Moore's Law ").)

# Effects of fab disruptions

Can we make any estimates about the fragility of the networks surrounding the chip fabs as well as the fabs themselves? Semiconductor chips are perhaps the epitome of an ["o-ring product"](!Wikipedia "O-Ring theory of economic development"): sophisticated products where a single mistake anywhere in a process with dozens or hundreds of steps renders the product valueless. A single defect in a 4-core processor may - at best - disable one of its cores, forcing the manufacturer to sell it for half or less, perhaps diverting it from high-end consumers like gamers to mass-market game consoles or other customers. (For example, the [PS3](!Wikipedia)'s [Cell processor](!Wikipedia "Cell (microprocessor)") has 8 cores but ships with just 7 functioning because the manufacturing yield of functioning Cells is [so low](http://www.dailytech.com/IBM+Says+Its+Lucky+to+Get+10+to+20+Yields+on+Cell+Processor/article3295.htm "IBM Says It's Lucky to Get 10% to 20% Yields on Cell Processor").)

## Case studies
### Kryder's Law

As it happens, history recently gifted us with a beautiful example which enables us to answer in the affirmative: yes, progress *is* fragile. The October [2011 Thailand floods](!Wikipedia "2011 Thailand floods#Damages to industrial estates and global supply shortages") struck at the hub of a quarter of global hard drive manufacturing capability. Western Digital restarted [one flooded plant in December](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/company-329634-million-digital.html) but others would not be online until March 2012.

The floods enable us to give a quantitative measure of how much progress was set back. Hard drives follow [Kryder's law](!Wikipedia), a halving every 12 months. As it happens, on 3/28/2011 I purchased one of the [cheapest hard drives](http://forre.st/storage#hdd) at that point, a 1.5tb Samsung hard drive for $51. By Kryder's law, in March 2012, I would be able to purchase 3tb for ~$50. But as a matter of fact, the cheapest Newegg drive is $120 for 2tb. An equivalent 1.5tb drive is now not $25 as one would have predicted before the floods, but a cool $100. And the cheapest 3tb drive is $200. So not only did one crank of Kryder's law (a halving) not happen, a previous turn of the law was reversed, doubling prices; so we can estimate that Kryder's law has been set back by *2 years* by some "slow-moving"[^flood-effects] flooding conducted by brainless natural forces.

[^flood-effects]: ["Thailand Flooding Cripples Hard-Drive Suppliers"](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/business/global/07iht-floods07.html), _The New York Times_:

    > "The slow-moving floodwaters, which are an accumulation from this year’s unusually strong monsoon rains in northern Thailand, are gradually draining into the sea. At what is known as the Bang Pa-In Industrial Estate, trucks have delivered massive pumps. Workers said they would start trying to remove water from the area on Monday. The floodwaters descended to this area an hour north of Bangkok in early October. Efforts to defend industrial areas with sandbags and other barriers were futile.
    >
    > “There was no way we could have held back the water,” said Samruay Pakubol, a welder at an automotive parts factory here. Now out of work, he takes passengers on a wooden boat down the streets of the industrial zone. Workers have caught and killed crocodiles swimming in the area, he said.
    >
    > Dale Schudel, managing director of IntriPlex Thailand, a company that makes components for hard-disk drives, said his factory in nearby Ayutthaya had floodwaters almost six feet deep. But pumping out the water, which will take about two to three weeks, is only the beginning of the cleanup. Mr. Schudel described the water as “highly corrosive.” “I think you have to ask yourself, if any factory in the world were submerged in that much water, how much damage would there be?” he said."

It seems unlikely that chip fabs are remarkably more robust.

### Toshiba NAND Flash memory

In 8 December 2010, the power grid serving a [Toshiba-Sandisk](http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2010_07/pr1401.htm "Toshiba Starts Construction of Fab 5 for NAND Flash Memory at Yokkaichi, Toshiba and SanDisk Sign Joint Venture Agreement: Responding to growing demand for the NAND Flash Memory") chip fab (specializing in Flash memory) suffered a brief fall in voltage beyond what the fab's local [uninterruptible power supplies](!Wikipedia) were designed for. This resulted in a fab-wide power interruption of less than a tenth of a second (~0.07). [Toshiba reported](http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2010_12/pr1001.htm "Toshiba Yokkaichi Operations Resumes Normal Operations") it took the plant 2 days to return to 100% operation. This cut production for the quarter by 20%, and worldwide production by 7.5% (according to iSuppli's Yang, quoted by the _WSJ_[^WSJ-Toshiba]). Coverage of this incident mentioned previous incidents in 2007 and 2000[^Phillips]

(Given the costs involved, one might expect reliable UPSes to be default, but also remember that this fabs can be using anywhere up to the dozens of megawatts range of electricity, which might be difficult to completely UPS.)

[^WSJ-Toshiba]: ["Power Blip Jolts Supply of Gadget Chips"](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703766704576009071694055878.html), December 10, 2010, _WSJ_:

    > "Toshiba said the power outage could cause a 20% drop in its shipments over the next two months or so of chips known as NAND flash memory, which are used to store music, photos and data in products such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone and iPad. Toshiba, which makes the chips in partnership with Silicon Valley company SanDisk Corp., represents about a third of the market as the second-largest supplier of the chips after Samsung Electronics Co. After the next couple months, the outage isn't expected to have a significant impact on world-wide shipments of flash memory. Some big buyers of the chips, such as Apple, have long-term supply arrangements with multiple chip makers. But the temporary disruption comes as demand for NAND flash is surging, notably from companies hoping to offer new tablet computers to challenge the iPad. Market watchers say some companies could face tight supplies and higher prices just as they are trying to ramp up production.
    >
    > "I don't think it could come at a worse time," said Krishna Shankar, an analyst at ThinkEquity.
    >
    > Toshiba's troubles started early Wednesday when, according to power supplier Chubu Electric Power Co., there was a sudden drop in voltage that caused a 0.07-second power interruption at Toshiba's Yokkaichi memory-chip plant in Mie prefecture. Even the briefest power interruption to the complex machines that make chips can have an effect comparable to disconnecting the power cord on a desktop computer, since the computerized controls on the systems must effectively be rebooted, said Dan Hutcheson, a chip-manufacturing analyst at VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif. For that reason, chip companies typically take precautions that include installing what the industry calls uninterruptible power supplies. Part of Toshiba's safeguards didn't work this time because the voltage drop was more severe than what the backup system is designed to handle, a company spokesman said. Power outages frequently cause damage to chips, which are fabricated on silicon wafers about the size of dinner plates that may take eight to 12 weeks to process, Mr. Hutcheson said. Wafers that are inside processing machines at the time of an outage are often ruined, he added, though many that are in storage or in transit among those machines are not. In some cases, a shutdown of the air-purifying and conditioning system that keeps air in a chip factory free of dust also could contaminate chips. Mr. Hutcheson compared the situation to cutting off the power to an artificial heart machine in the middle of an operation. "You lose the patient," he said. On the other hand, he said that Toshiba's estimate of the impact is a worst-case scenario that may wind up to be substantially less. Toshiba estimated that its shipments of NAND flash memory could decline by as much as 20% through February as a result of the outage. Based on the company's share of the market, such a reduction would translate into a 7.5% cut in world-wide shipments over that period, but a much smaller percentage for all of 2011, estimated Michael Yang, an analyst at the technology market research firm iSuppli.
    >
    > "The impact for the year is nothing," Mr. Yang said, though he added it could temporarily raise NAND prices.
    >
    > Such problems are far from unprecedented. In August 2007, a power outage at Samsung's memory-chip plant near Seoul forced the company to temporarily halt some production lines. Mr. Yang said that cased prices for chips to rise for a few months. Timothy Luke, an analyst at Barclays Capital, estimated the outage would reduce 2011 NAND flash chip supplies by 3% to 5%, possibly boosting prices to the benefit of rivals such as Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. A SanDisk spokesman declined to comment on the outage. One mitigating factor is that chip demand is typically lighter in January and February than other parts of the year, which could reduce the chances of a shortage. On the other hand, demand for NAND chips has been rising at an unusual rate, driven largely by sales of smartphones and tablets. ISuppli in September predicted that global shipments of NAND flash-memory chips by volume would jump 70% next year."

It unfolds a story about how a St. Patrick's Day (17 March 2000) lightning strike in Albuquerque, New Mexico, started a fire in Fabricator No. 22 of a Phillips NV chip manufacturing plant which led to unforeseen long-term consequences. Alert plant employees and automatic sprinklers put the fire out in less than ten minutes. Sheffi wrote, "A routine investigation showed that the fire had been minor. Nobody was hurt and the damage seemed superficial. The blaze did not make headlines in Europe, did not appear on CNN, and did not even appear in the Albuquerque newspapers."...The fire had directly ruined only eight trays of wafers but smoke from the fire spread beyond the immediate area and, along with soot spread by workers and firefighters, contaminated much of the rest of plant. A minor fire had turned into a major disaster. Sheffi reported that Phillips notified its 30-plus customers about potential delays in chip production but predicted the delay would only be about a week...as soon as it [Nokia] realized that the delay was actually going to be weeks or months, it took action...Ericsson wasn't quite so lucky. Sheffi reported that Ericsson executives received the same telephone call from Phillips as Nokia but they reacted very differently. They believed that the delay would be a short one...According to Sheffi, Ericsson's lack of a Plan B cost the company around half a billion dollars."

## State-actors: Why Not Terrorism

We have seen how difficult fabs are to make, how few they are, how even small disruptions spiral into global shifts. Does this imply that regulation could be accomplished by any modestly capable group, such as a [Unabomber](!Wikipedia) [imitator](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2009/02/the_unabomber_w.php "'The Unabomber Was Right', Kevin Kelly") or a souped-up [ITS](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110822/full/476373a.html "Stand up against the anti-technology terrorists")?

No:

1. the size, scale, and remoteness from neighboring buildings of chip fabs implies both that securing them against conventional paramilitary assault is easy, and as a percentage of costs, trivial. Securing them against conventional *military* assault (cruise missiles, artillery strikes, etc.) is nontrivial but also not necessary as no terrorist groups operating in the relevant countries has access to such equipment and personnel. Terrorists are [barely OK at attacking soft civilian targets](Terrorism is not Effective) which are easy to access and impossible to defend.
2. Terrorist groups are [intrinsically dysfunctional](Terrorism is not about Terror) from the point of view of getting things done, as evidenced by their internal dynamics and personal motivations
3. Trans-national terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda have demonstrated in the 2000s that they are not resilient to allied government suppression^[A point vividly illustrated by video of Osama bin Laden in his Pakistani safehouse before his death, watching himself on TV, and vainly writing endless emails to his remaining subordinates and wishful plotting.]

    Where such groups succeed, it is by a kind of 'franchise' strategy where the local members and grievances take dominance. At best, facilities could be attacked in one country and its neighbors, which would certainly delay progress but on a time-scale measured in months or years rather than decades, as the industry routes around the damage.
4. There is no possible benefit to the terrorist group succeeding

    This is a highly speculative utilitarian strategy, which could win no fervent adherents (no soldier jumps on a grenade for the sake of a cost-benefit equation), as success is measured in just the status quo - no faster chips - and one of the few scenarios in which one could have evidence of success would be the creation of de novo AGI, at which point one has more interesting concerns.  Similarly abstract ideals like Communism have always been able to promise their adherents more concrete benefits like groupies or high positions after the war.

All of these, however, imply that a nation or coalition of nations could: nations obviously have conventional forces, somewhat functioning decision processes, international pull and combat capability (especially in the case of the USA's Air Force or any nation possessing cruise or ballistic missiles), and value the status quo in which they are top of the food chain. Some governments are even so farsighted as to work on [existential risks](!Wikipedia "Asteroid-impact avoidance").

## Covert fabs?

The special construction, power & water consumption, and sheer scale of chip fabs suggest that it would be difficult to covertly build a competitive underground chip fab. The fragility of clean rooms suggest chip fabs could withstand little damage. For commercial reasons, all existing facilities appear to be located within US allies and within even short fighter ranges of American military bases (for example [all Intel's facilities](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/fullimage.php?image=2572 "Intel's global operations")).

## Hardened non-covert fabs

Hardening does not seem to be an answer. Leaving aside the previous observation that it's unclear whether companies (or even nation-states) can survive the construction costs of unhardened fabs, even basic hardening is expensive. [Linger et al 2002](http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=george_h_baker "Applications of Underground Structures for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure") argues that contrary to the usual estimates (that ordinary underground construction costs [3-5x](http://www.undergroundconstructionmagazine.com/%E2%80%98hardening%E2%80%99-power-lines "'Hardening' Power Lines") normal construction costs), Norwegian construction reports (with their long experience in underground construction) for power stations and waste treatment plants indicate that underground construction premiums are more like 1.25x and may even save money in the long run. An Army overview agrees[^Army]. These hardening cost-estimates, however, are not for structures robust against nuclear or bunker-busting bombs, which require overburdens up to 2000 feet. The [Cheyenne Mountain](!Wikipedia) complex is smaller than what might be needed to contain & defend a post-2012 chip fab against US assault; a [1997 page](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/usspc-fs/cmoctrivia.htm) mentions "duplicating this facility today with all of its missions would cost about 18 billion US dollars" (based on its 1965 construction cost of $142m, which inflation-adjusted is ~10 times larger). So optimistically, hardening would cost another 25% (>$5b based on the TSMC Fab 15 estimate) or more than 500% (>$125b likewise).

[^Army]: [technical report M-85/11 "Literature Survey of Underground Construction Methods for Application to Hardened Facilities"](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a155212.pdf "Kao 1985"):

    > "An evaluation of a nuclear power plant concept [79] revealed that locating the facility underground with a cut and cover technique would be 11% more expensive than an aboveground plan. The increased cost was attributed to direct construction costs being 70% higher, the need for special equipment for ventilation and other functions, and the additional time required to build the underground structure. More costs are incurred from hardening underground tunnels to resist blasts or seismic loads. A design cost study [85] estimates that hardening a tunnel to resist a seismic load of 0.5 g would increase construction costs by 35%...Underground subway station construction costs were also compared to show that an underground station using a tunneled earth excavation technique with an 85-ft (25.5-m) overburden would cost about 25% more than one constructed by cut and cover methods with a 20-ft (6-m) earth cover, an 47% more than a cut and cover station with a 6-ft (1.8-m) cover...Reference 77 compares the cost of siting a nuclear power plant underground. The investigation found that a cut and cover buried facility would cost 14-25% more and a mined rock plant 10-18% more than a surface power plant. A second report [86] states that costs for siting a nuclear power plant underground in rock are about 25% more. Reference 80 examines the costs of underground homes and large public buildings. Based on life-cycle cost figures of 5 case studies: 'It does appear clear, however, that the use of earth-sheltering does not increase construction costs in any notable way, and may in fact represent a decrease in some cases' [80]. An example earth-sheltered house is cited as costing 28% more to construct, but 12-20% less to own and operate over the 30-year life of the home."
