...

    But we all will be alone,
    illusions moving in memory,
    someday, surely, so:
    show no sorrow, laugh and love,
    bravely walk bearing no wish but
    to live while you will live -
    and not forget these feelings.

    See your school yard;
    blanched blackboards,
    gleaming grinders,
    sharp sticky seats,
    restless paper piles recalling
    cheerful companions of childhood.

    As we remember:
    collecting pebbles in the corner pile,
    calling excitedly as we cache each
    and smooth the soft tar sphere;
    next, sharp glass now sand-ground.

    As we remember:
    dashing through the double trees
    jumping by jammed branches
    trespassing to free trapped friends.

    As we remember:
    bricks scribbled with boyish secrets,
    read only by the oily rains.

    As we remember:
    even when everyone's world ends,

    sunlight shafting through the silent school.
