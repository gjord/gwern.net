     "How long will this last?
     I'm so tired of these games."
     «We've only begun; how is it the same?
     Just wait and this soon will pass.»

     And he said to me:
     "I just can't no mo'"
     As we sat and played Halo...

     "Look at that cute fake:
     You've bought something else shiny new."
     «Why should that matter to you?
     Reality does not pleasure or beauty make.»

     And he said to me:
     "I can't look no mo'"
     As we watched my brown Aibo...

     "In life I just want to soar
     But these machines always drag me down."
     «All the time wearing a frown,
     Never satisfied, forever wanting more?»

     So he said to me.
     But I replied no mo',
     and watched a hybrid rainbow...
